  The NGFS Orderly transition risk scenarios result in a gradual reduction in CO₂ emissions 
  and an increase in the carbon price. Investments in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies 
  are projected to significantly increase. For example, annual investment in low carbon technologies 
  increases from ~1 billion and 1.5 trillion USD in 2025 to between ~2 trillion and ~3 trillion USD by 
  2030, rising modestly to ~2.5 trillion USD and ~3 trillion USD by 2050, peaking at ~4 trillion in 2035 
  for the Net Zero 2050 scenario. 

  Global global mean temperatures are projected to peak across the world by at 1.5&deg;C, compared 
  to pre-industrial levels by 2030 and remain same for Low demand scenario. However, slightly increases 
  to 1.6&deg;C - 1.7&deg;C by 2050 for the other two scenarios, giving rise to high physical risk 
  (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming).These scenarios 
  could also lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, labour productivity (e.g. the 
  decrease in labour productivity due to the reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical labour 
  under hot and humid climate conditions), agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also further 
  change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and 
  flooding. 
  
  The total cumulative GDP impact from chronic physical and transition effects relative to a baseline 
  (with no transition or physical risks) is c.-6% by 2030 and c.-8% to -11% by 2050. In the Orderly scenarios, 
  physical risks, namely chronic physical risks, have a larger impact on global GDP than transition risk (i.e., 
  -5% impact for physical risk compared to between -0.2% to -0.9% for transition risk), even as early as 2030 and 
  -10% by 2050. It is noted that macroeconomic impacts are not available for the Low Demand scenario.

  Note: The NGFS Orderly scenarios have some limitations that should be carefully considered, 
  as they could lead to uncertainties in the projections. For example: 

  - Simplified assumptions about future policies, technologies, and economic developments.
  - Incomplete coverage of physical impacts like tipping points and compound risks.
  - Limited consideration of societal impacts, such as climate-induced migration.
  - Uncertainty about future technology and government policy changes.
  - Incomplete capture of financial sector dynamics and responses.
  
  NGFS risk assessments may require complementary assessments to align with users’ specific objectives. 
  Understanding these limitations is important to better manage and mitigate climate-related risks. 
  Despite these limitations, the NGFS scenarios provide valuable insights and a common framework for 
  analysing climate-related risks.

  Orderly transition scenarios assume climate policies are introduced early and become 
  gradually more stringent. Both physical and transition risks are relatively subdued.

  [NGFS Climate Scenarios, November 2024](https://www.ngfs.net/system/files/import/ngfs/medias/documents/ngfs_scenarios_main_presentation.pdf)

  The NGFS have defined three orderly scenarios:

  - **Net Zero 2050** limits global warming to 1.5&deg;C through stringent climate
    policies and innovation, reaching global Net Zero CO₂ emissions
    around 2050.

  - **Below 2&deg;C** gradually increases the stringency of climate policies, giving
    a 67% chance of limiting global warming to below 2&deg;C.

  - **Low Demand** assumes that significant behavioural changes – reducing energy demand – 
  in addition to (shadow) carbon price and technology induced e¬fforts, would mitigate pressure 
  on the economy to reach global Net Zero CO₂ emissions around 2050.

  ### Key assumptions and parameters

  In these scenarios the reduction in CO₂ emissions occurs gradually 
  (i.e., between a ~20 – 40% reduction in 2030, and ~75 – 105% reduction by 2050). 
  This is achieved by an immediate and/or smooth policy reaction decarbonising the 
  energy supply, accelerating electrification and switching to low-carbon fuels in industry, 
  transport and buildings, deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and 
  increasing afforestation and reforestation.

  The price of carbon is highest in the Net Zero 2050 scenario compared to the 
  Below 2&deg;C or Low Demand scenario (at 2030, ~185 USD per tonne CO₂ adjusted to 2010 baseline, 
  compared to 32 USD and ~110 USD respectively; while at 2050, ~750 USD, compared to 135 USD 
  and ~490 USD respectively). This is due to the more rigorous targets of limiting global warming 
  to a maximum of 1.5&deg;C (versus 2&deg;C in the Below 2&deg;C scenario), and compared to the Low Demand scenario, 
  where additional levers in end-use sectors (e.g., behavioural changes, reducing energy demand, inducing 
  faster electrification, and substitution through renewables) mitigate the pressure on carbon taxes to induce the transition. 
  Together, market and policy factors give rise to transition risks across the three scenarios.

  **Source:**
  [IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer. REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8.](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads) Carbon prices are weighted global averages.

  Government revenues from carbon tax increase in line with the carbon price, 
  until emissions are reduced to a degree that this offsets the carbon price increase. 
  For the Net Zero 2050 scenario, global government carbon tax revenues increase, peaking 
  at ~4.6 trillion USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) per year around 2030 before 
  sloping back down to ~460 billion USD per year by 2050. The Low Demand scenario sees 
  similar trends however at a more muted peak of ~2.5 trillion USD per year by 2030, 
  reducing to ~775 billion USD per year by 2050. In the Below 2&deg;C scenario, revenues 
  peak at ~1.5-1.6 trillion USD per year around 2040 and remain at this level up to 2050.

  In many countries, the implementation of carbon prices in the transition scenarios 
  tends to raise energy costs in the short-term, which initially weighs on prices (as 
  lower demand and financial market losses hit outputs). This causes an initial strain on 
  the economy through decreased demand and market losses, Rising carbon prices subsequently 
  feed through to modest increases in inflation and unemployment before returning to prior 
  trends. In some countries and time periods the offsetting positive growth effects from 
  carbon revenue recycling could lead to a reduction in unemployment. Long-term interest 
  rates tend to increase in the transition scenarios (i.e., rising to 0.81% and 0.16% above 
  the baseline in 2030, and 0.87% and 0.32% above the baseline in 2050 for the UK for 
  the Net Zero 2050 and Below 2&deg;C scenarios respectively), reflecting the inflationary 
  pressure created by carbon prices, as well as the increased investment demand that the 
  transition spurs on. on.

  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected to increase, 
  where the Low Demand and Net Zero 2050 scenarios are expected to be higher than the Below 2&deg;C 
  scenario. Overall, firms could be required to readjust their capital expenditure in line with 
  these trends, developing more efficient and less carbon-intensive products and services in order 
  to adhere to carbon pricing policies. The technologies that result from these investments could 
  also adjust asset valuations of relatively older technology. Annual investment in energy efficiency 
  increases from ~250 billion USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) in 2025 to between ~280 billion 
  and ~368 billion USD in 2030 and between ~540 billion USD and ~1 trillion USD by 2050, whilst annual investment 
  in low carbon technologies increases from ~1 billion and 1.5 trillion USD in 2025 to between ~2 trillion and 
  ~3 trillion USD by 2030, rising modestly to ~2.5 trillion USD and ~3 trillion USD by 2050, peaking at ~4 
  trillion in 2035 for the Net Zero 2050 scenario.

  Observed climate change has already increased global mean temperatures above
  1.4&deg;C, compared to pre-industrial levels, and both the global land area and
  the global population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, cyclones, 
  wildfire, drought and heatwaves has more than doubled. (See Lange, S. et al. (2020)).

  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in
  the atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and are
  extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th
  century. In these scenarios global mean temperatures are projected to peak across 
  the world by at 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels by 2030 and remain same 
  for Low demand scenario. However, slightly increases to 1.6&deg;C - 1.7&deg;C by 2050 
  for the other two scenarios, giving rise to moderately high physical risk (with 
  land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming).

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, 
  labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also 
  further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, 
  droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. For example, across the Net Zero 2050, 
  Below 2&deg;C and Low Demand scenarios, we can observe the following changes:
  
  * Labour productivity decreases from -1.7% in 2030 to between – 1.7% and -2.3% by 2050 
  due to the reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical labour under hot and 
  humid climate conditions. This decrease is more pronounced for the Below 2°C scenario. 
  Although the fall in productivity will vary by specific location, in the UK this 
  decrease is expected to  relatively subdued.

  * Annual economic damages from cyclones are also projected to increase, peaking 
  at ~8% above reference period levels in 2030 for the three scenarios, and peaking 
  at ~16% in 2050 for the Below 2&deg;C scenario. There is no change in Low demand scenario 
  between 2030 and 2050. The Net Zero 2050 increases to ~10% in 2050.

  In these scenarios, the total cumulative GDP impact from chronic physical 
  and transition effects relative to a baseline (with no transition or physical 
  risks) is c.-6% by 2030 and c.-8% to -11% by 2050. GDP impacts from transition 
  risk are moderately negative in the Net Zero 2050 scenario as negative impacts 
  on demand from higher carbon prices and energy costs are only partially offset 
  by the recycling of carbon revenues into government investment and lower employment 
  taxes. In the Orderly scenarios, physical risks, namely chronic physical risks, have 
  a larger impact on global GDP than transition risk (i.e., -5% impact for physical risk 
  compared to between -0.2% to -0.9% for transition risk), even as early as 2030 and -10% by 2050. 
  It is noted that macroeconomic impacts are not available for the Low Demand scenario.

  **Source:**
  [IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer. NiGEM NGFS v1.24.2 [REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8].](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads) NiGEM NGFS v1.24.2 is not available for Low Demand scenario; only chronic physical data available (not acute physical).

  Overall, these are more optimistic scenarios, as while transition risks lead to negative 
  short-term impacts on GDP, the cost-saving later more than offsets these initial losses 
  compared to the Disorderly, Hot House World and Too-little-too-late scenarios. 
  Despite the focus on transition risk for the Orderly scenarios, chronic physical risk is 
  the main source of risk (and in all scenarios), whereby in the short-term (by 2030), these 
  impacts are non-negligible, greatly outweighing the cost of an early and orderly transitions. 
  Physical risk losses peak before mid-century in the Net Zero 2050 scenario.
