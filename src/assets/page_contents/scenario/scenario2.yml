  The NGFS Disorderly transition scenarios assume the introduction of effective policy change 
  is delayed across countries and sectors. In the Delayed transition scenario, CO2 emissions do 
  not decrease until 2030, and a steep increase in the carbon price is required thereafter to 
  compensate for this inaction. 
  
  In the Delayed transition scenario, the global mean temperatures are projected to increase across the 
  world by 1.5°C by 2030 to 1.8°C by 2050, above pre-industrial levels, giving rise to moderately high 
  physical risk (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming).
  
  The total cumulative GDP impact from chronic physical and transition effects relative to a baseline 
  with no transition or physical risks is estimated to be just under -5.2% by 2030 and -13% by 2050.
  
  The Delayed transition scenario could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, 
  labour productivity (due to the reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical labour under 
  hot and humid climate conditions), agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also further 
  change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. 
  
  The total cumulative GDP impact from chronic physical and transition effects relative to a baseline 
  with no transition or physical risks is estimated to be just under -5.2% by 2030 and -13% by 2050.  
  In the Delayed transition risk scenario, physical risks have a larger impact on global GDP than transition 
  risks. There is no impact of transition risk in 2030. The NGFS estimate that global GDP impact in the 
  Delayed transition scenario will be around -13% by 2050.

  Note: The NGFS Delayed transition scenario has some limitations that 
  should be carefully considered, as they could lead to uncertainties in the projections. For example: 

   - Simplified assumptions about future policies, technologies, and economic developments.
   
   - Incomplete coverage of physical impacts like tipping points and compound risks.
   
   - Limited consideration of societal impacts, such as climate-induced migration.
   
   - Uncertainty about future technology and government policy changes, namely the scenarios 
   account for political and economic conditions becoming increasingly disorderly, which in 
   turn has an impact on future transition pathways.
   
   - Incomplete capture of financial sector dynamics and responses.

   NGFS risk assessments may require complementary assessments to align with users’ specific objectives. 
   Understanding these limitations is important to better manage and mitigate climate-related risks. 
   Despite these limitations, the NGFS Delayed transition scenario provide valuable insights into the 
   potential risks and challenges of a delayed or inconsistent approach to climate policy.

  Disorderly transition scenarios explore higher transition risks due to policies being delayed or 
  divergent level of actions across countries and sectors based on currently implemented policies. 
  For example, carbon prices are typically higher for a given temperature outcome.

  The NGFS have provided one Disorderly scenario:

  - **Delayed transition** assumes that global annual emissions do not decrease and 
  there is no additional climate policies implemented until 2030. Strong policies are 
  needed to limit warming to below 2°C. Negative emissions are limited.

  ### Key assumptions and parameters{.unlisted .unnumbered}

  In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy action results in higher emissions 
  (by ~0.5%) until 2030. Policies drive a sharp decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions after 2030 
  to compensate for the inaction beforehand causing a drop in emissions by ~84% by 2050.

  In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction means that a ‘Business-as-Usual’ 
  approach to decarbonisation occurs between now and 2030, followed by a sharp increase in 
  policy aggression, resulting in the carbon price increase to 320 USD per tonne CO<sub>2</sub> by 2050 
  based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs). The delayed policy 
  ambition reduces the initial dis-incentivisation against fossil fuels, only to more 
  aggressively penalise and thus risk stranding fossil fuel assets beyond 2030. In this 
  scenario, disorderly policy action results in increased transition risks.

  [IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer. REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8.](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads) Carbon prices are weighted global averages.

  Government revenues from carbon tax increase in line with the carbon price, until 2035 
  when emissions are reduced to a degree that this offsets carbon price increase. In the 
  Delayed transition risk scenario, revenues remain fairly flat at ~380 billion USD in 2030 
  and peak at ~3.2 trillion USD per year around 2035. By 2050, revenues drop by 43% 
  (~1.8 trillion USD per year).

  In many countries, the implementation of carbon prices in the transition scenarios 
  tends to raise energy costs in the short-term, initially weighing down on prices 
  (as lower demand and financial market losses hit outputs). Rising carbon prices 
  subsequently feed through to modest increases in inflation and unemployment before 
  returning to prior trends. In some countries and time periods the offsetting positive 
  growth effects from carbon revenue recycling leads to a reduction in unemployment. 
  Long-term interest rates tend to increase in the transition scenarios (i.e., no change 
  relative to baseline in 2030 and 0.5% higher than baseline in 2050), reflecting the 
  inflationary pressure created by carbon prices, as well as the increased investment 
  demand that the transition spurs on. In the disorderly scenarios policy uncertainty 
  leads to a higher investment premium. This trend remains until 2050 in all the scenarios.

  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected to 
  increase in the Delayed transition scenario. Overall, firms could be required to 
  re-adjust their capital expenditure in line with these trends, developing more efficient 
  and less carbon-intensive products and services in order to adhere to carbon pricing policies. 
  The technologies that result from these investments could also adjust asset valuations of 
  relatively older technology. In delayed transition scenario, annual investment in energy 
  efficiency increases from around 240 billion USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) 
  in 2025 to a mere 250 billion USD by 2030, accelerating to ~536 billion USD by 2050, 
  whilst annual investment in low carbon increases from ~1 trillion USD (2025) to ~1.4 
  trillion USD in 2030, and further to ~3 trillion USD by 2050.

  Observed climate change has already increased global mean temperatures above 1.1&deg;C, 
  compared to pre-industrial levels, and both the global land area and the global 
  population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, cyclones, wildfire, 
  drought and heatwaves has already more than doubled (See Lange, S. et al. (2020)). 
  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the 
  atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and are extremely 
  likely to have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century. 
  In these scenarios global mean temperatures are projected to increase across 
  the world by 1.5&deg;C by 2030 to 1.8&deg;C by 2050, above pre-industrial levels, 
  giving rise to moderately high physical risk (with land warming faster 
  than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming).

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, 
  labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also further 
  change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, 
  cyclones, and flooding. For example, in the delayed transition risk scenario we could see the following:
  
  * A decrease in labour productivity to circa -1.7% in 2030 and circa -2.2% in 2050 
  due to the reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical labour under hot 
  and humid climate conditions. Although this will depend on location, and in the UK 
  this decrease may be relatively subdued.

  * The annual economic damages from cyclones are also projected to increase, 
  but to a lesser extent; peaking at ~8% in 2030 and ~16% in 2050 which is 
  above reference period levels of 1986-2006.

  In this scenario the total cumulative GDP impact from chronic physical and 
  transition effects relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks 
  is estimated to be just under -5.2% by 2030 and -13% by 2050. World GDP losses 
  from physical risks vary in line with different temperatures projected for each 
  scenario. World GDP impacts from delayed transition risks are negative as the speed 
  of the transition combines with investment uncertainty and affects consumption and 
  investment. In this scenario, there is a large mix of physical and transition risks 
  in 2050. In the Delayed transition risk scenario, physical risks have a larger impact 
  on global GDP than transition risks. There is no impact of transition risk in 2030. 
  The NGFS estimate that global GDP impact in the Delayed transition scenario will be around -13% by 2050.

  NiGEM NGFS v1.24.2 is not available for Low Demand scenario; Only chronic physical data available (not acute physical).

  Overall, the Delayed transition scenario leaves a limited timeframe for countries, 
  companies and the population to adapt to climate change.
