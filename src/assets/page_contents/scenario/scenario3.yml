  In the NGFS Hot House World scenarios CO₂ emissions do not decrease, and carbon prices 
  do not increase sufficiently to prevent significant temperature rises resulting in high 
  physical risk. In these scenarios global mean temperatures are projected to increase to 
  1.5°C by 2030 and to 1.9°C - 2°C by 2050, giving rise to high physical risk.
  
  This could lead to a significant chronic change in living conditions affecting health, 
  labour productivity (due to the reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical 
  labour under hot and humid climate conditions), agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. 
  It can also change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, 
  wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. The total GDP impact from chronic physical and transition 
  effects relative to a baseline (with no transition or physical risks) is estimated to be around 
  -5% to 6% by 2030 and -13% to -15% by 2050, which is the highest impact apart from the 
  Too-little-too-late scenario.

  Note: The NGFS Hot House World scenarios have some limitations that should be carefully
  considered, as they could lead to uncertainties in the projections. For example:
  
  - Simplified assumptions about future policies, technologies, and economic developments.
  
  - Incomplete coverage of physical impacts like tipping points and compound risks.
  
  - Incomplete coverage of acute physical risks – i.e., four acute physical impacts are 
  modelled using one transmission channel (flood and cyclones through capital asset damages; 
  droughts through crop yield losses; heatwaves through labour productivity decline).
  
  - Simplified use of the damage function – i.e., within the NGFS framework the damage function accounts only for damages from chronic physical risk, while losses from acute physical risk are considered separately.
  
  - Limited consideration of societal impacts, such as climate-induced migration.
  
  - Uncertainty about future technology and government policy changes.
  
  - Incomplete capture of financial sector dynamics and responses.
  
  NGFS risk assessments may require complementary assessments to align with users’ specific objectives. 
  Understanding these limitations is important to better manage and mitigate climate-related risks. 
  Despite these limitations, the NGFS Hot House World scenarios provide humbling insights into the 
  (potential) severity of risks and challenges of insufficient climate policy and actions.

  Hot House World scenarios assume that some climate policies are implemented in some
  jurisdictions, but globally efforts are insufficient to halt significant
  global warming leading to severe physical risk including irreversible impacts.

  The NGFS have provided two Hot House World scenarios:

  - **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** includes all pledged targets
    even if not yet backed up by implemented effective policies.

  - **Current Policies** assumes that only currently implemented policies are
    preserved, leading to high physical risks.

  ### Key assumptions and parameters
  
  In these scenarios CO₂ emissions do not decrease sufficiently, notably 
  in the Current Policies scenario (i.e., emissions increase by ~0.5% in 2030 and reduce 
  by 6% in 2050 for the Current Policies scenario compared to a drop in emissions by ~16% in 
  2030 and 54% by 2050 for the Nationally Determined Contribution scenario) to prevent significant 
  temperature rises resulting in high physical risk.

  Carbon price is a measure of overall policy intensity. Emission prices are sensitive to 
  the timing of policy implementation. With none or relatively small additions to current 
  policy, these scenarios have low carbon prices throughout, i.e., for Current Policies scenario, 
  carbon price remains relatively flat at around 11 USD per tonne CO₂ (baselined to 2010 prices) 
  throughout the duration between 2025 – 2050; while for the Nationally Determined Contributions 
  scenario, carbon prices rise to ~85 USD in 2030 and remains roughly flat until 2050. 
  Therefore, transition risks are much less significant in these scenarios.

  [IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer. REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8.](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads) Carbon prices are weighted global averages.
  
  Government revenues from carbon tax are affected by carbon price and emissions. 
  Revenues are relatively low in the Current Policies scenarios given the low carbon price 
  (i.e., ~400 billion USD compared to ~1.7 trillion USD in 2025). 
  The Nationally Determined Contributions scenario assumes a slightly higher carbon price, 
  resulting in a modest increase in revenues from ~1.7 billion USD in 2025, peaking to 
  ~2.2 billion USD in 2030 due to relatively high emissions (compared to Orderly and Disorderly scenarios). 
  Revenues remain fairly flat thereafter across both scenarios, with 375 billion USD and ~1 trillion USD 
  by 2050 for the Current Policies and NDCs scenarios respectively.

  In Hot House World scenarios, the lack of carbon price increase results in less 
  severe deviation of inflation, unemployment, and long-term interest rates from the baseline scenario, 
  compared to Orderly and Disorderly scenarios, i.e., never going beyond c.0.3% above 
  or below the baseline from 2030 - 2050.

  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected 
  to increase in Hot House World scenarios. Annual investment in energy efficiency 
  increases from ~240 billion USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) in 2025 to 
  between 250 billion and ~285 billion USD in 2030, and between ~280 billion and 
  ~500 billion USD by 2050, whilst annual investment in low carbon increases from 
  ~1 trillion and ~1.3 trillion USD in 2025 to between ~1.4 trillion and ~2.2 trillion USD 
  in 2030, and between ~2 trillion and 2.45 trillion USD by 2050. 
  However, this increase is relatively small compared to other scenarios.

  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the 
  atmosphere are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and are extremely 
  likely to have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century. 
  Observed climate change is already at 1.4°C above pre-industrial levels and has 
  more than doubled global land area and global population annually exposed to river flood, 
  crop failure, cyclones, wildfire, drought and heatwaves. In the Hot House World scenarios, 
  global mean temperatures are projected to increase to 1.5°C by 2030 and to 1.9°C - 2°C by 2050, 
  giving rise to high physical risk  (with land warming faster than oceans and high
  latitudes experiencing higher warming).

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, labour 
  productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also change the frequency 
  and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. 
  For example, in the Current Policies and Nationally Determined Contributions scenarios 
  we can observe the following changes: 
  
  * A decrease in labour productivity to circa -1.7% in 2030 and circa -2.6% in 2050 
  due to the reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical labour 
  under hot and humid climate conditions.

  * Annual economic damages from cyclones are also projected to increase above reference period levels, 
  to ~8% by 2030 and ~20% by 2050.

  In these scenarios the total GDP impact from chronic physical and transition effects 
  relative to a baseline (with no transition or physical risks) is estimated to be around 
  -5% to 6% by 2030 and -13% to -15% by 2050, which is the highest impact apart from the 
  Too-little-too-late scenario. World GDP losses from physical risks vary in line with 
  different temperatures projected for each scenario. As with other scenarios, the 
  impact on global GDP is dominated by physical risk (chronic). Transition risk impacts 
  in the Current Policies scenario is so low it does not impact global GDP at either 2030 or 2050.

  Overall, these scenarios result in high physical risk including irreversible impacts 
  like sea-level rise. Transition risks are much less significant in these scenarios 
  as only policies that are already implemented or pledged are in place.
