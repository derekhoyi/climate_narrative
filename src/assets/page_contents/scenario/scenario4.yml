  In the NGFS Fragmented World scenario, policy changes are introduced however 
  carbon prices do not increase and CO2 emissions do not decrease sufficiently 
  to prevent significant temperature rises. This results in both high impacts from 
  a physical and transition risk perspective, where global mean temperature is 
  projected to increase across the world by 1.5°C by 2030 and 1.9°C by 2050, 
  compared to pre-industrial levels, giving rise to high physical risk (with 
  land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming).
  
  This could lead to a significant chronic change in living conditions affecting health, 
  labour productivity (due to the reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical 
  labour under hot and humid climate conditions), agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. 
  It can also change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, 
  wildfires, cyclones, and flooding. The total cumulative GDP impact from chronic physical and 
  transition effects relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks is estimated to 
  be around -5.2% by 2030 and -13.6% by 2050, which is comparable to the Hot House World scenarios.

  Note: The NGFS Too-little-too-late scenarios have some limitations that should be 
  carefully considered, as they could lead to uncertainties in the projections. For example:

  - Simplified assumptions about future policies, technologies, and economic developments.
  
  - Incomplete coverage of physical impacts like tipping points and compound risks.
  
  - Incomplete coverage of acute physical risks – i.e., four acute physical impacts are modelled 
  using one transmission channel (flood and cyclones through capital asset damages; droughts 
  through crop yield losses; heatwaves through labour productivity decline).
  
  - Simplified use of the damage function – i.e., within the NGFS framework the damage function accounts 
  only for damages from chronic physical risk, while losses from acute physical risk are considered separately.
  
  - Limited consideration of societal impacts, such as climate-induced migration.
  
  - Uncertainty about future technology and government policy changes.
  
  - Incomplete capture of financial sector dynamics and responses
  
  NGFS risk aassessments may require complementary assessments to align 
  with users’ specific objectives. Understanding these limitations is 
  important to better manage and mitigate climate-related risks. 
  Despite these limitations, the NGFS Too-little-too-late scenario 
  provide humbling insights into the (potential) severity of risks 
  and challenges of insufficient and uncoordinated climate policy and actions.

  The NGFS have provided one Too little, too late scenario:

  - **Fragmented World** scenario assumes a delayed and divergent 
  climate policy response among countries globally, leading to high physical and transition risks. 
  Countries with net zero targets achieve these only partially (80% of the target), while the 
  other countries follow current policies.


  ### Key assumptions and parameters
  
  In this scenario, CO2 emission decrease is muted (i.e., rising in 2030 by ~0.5%, and dropping 
  by ~39% in 2050) and is not sufficient to prevent significant temperature rises resulting in 
  high physical risk.

  In line with delayed policy changes, carbon prices remain at 11 USD per tonne CO2 and are only 
  increased after 2030, however to a limited extent (i.e. only to ~57 USD baselined to 2010 prices 
  at 2050, which is less than those under the NDC scenario). Transition risks are therefore still 
  present however are less significant in than Orderly or Disorderly scenarios.

  Government revenues from carbon tax are affected by carbon price and emissions. As carbon prices 
  are slightly raised (only after 2030) and emissions remain relatively high, revenues are observed 
  to drop slightly from ~400 billion USD (2025) to ~380 billion USD at 2030, and a modestly increase 
  to ~1 trillion USD by 2050.

  Postponed transition actions lead to policy uncertainty, resulting in higher investment premiums 
  and a sharp deviation in inflation and unemployment from baseline after 2030. This last for c.10 years, 
  with the inflation and unemployment rates gradually returning to baseline thereafter. Long-term interest 
  rates increase from 2030 to 0.25% above the baseline in 2050, reflecting the inflationary pressure created 
  by limited rise in carbon prices, as well as the increased investment demand that the transition spurs on.

  The investments in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies are projected to increase, 
  albeit modestly, in the Fragmented World scenario. Annual investment in energy efficiency 
  increases from ~240 billion USD (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) in 2025 to a modest 
  250 billion USD in 2030, rising to ~360 billion USD by 2050, whilst annual investment in 
  low carbon increases from ~1 trillion USD in 2025 to ~1.45 trillion USD by 2030, further 
  increasing to ~2.4 trillion USD by 2050. These increases are relatively small compared 
  to other scenarios.

  The increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere 
  are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years and are extremely likely to have been 
  the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century. Observed climate change of 1.4°C, 
  compared to pre-industrial levels, has already more than doubled both the global land area 
  and the global population annually exposed to river flood, crop failure, cyclones, wildfire, 
  drought and heatwaves. In this scenario global mean temperature is projected to increase 
  across the world by 1.5°C by 2030 and 1.9°C by 2050, compared to pre-industrial levels, 
  giving rise to high physical risk (with land warming faster than oceans and high
  latitudes experiencing higher warming).

  These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, 
  labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also change 
  the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, 
  cyclones, and flooding. For example, in the Fragmented World scenario we see the following: 
  
  * A decrease in labour productivity from -1.7% in 2030 to -2.5% at 2050 due to the 
  reduced capacity of the human body to perform physical labour under hot and humid climate conditions.

  * Annual economic damages from cyclones are also projected to increase above 
  the reference period levels; to ~8% by 2030 and ~18% by 2050.

  In the Fragmented World scenario, the total cumulative GDP impact from chronic physical 
  and transition effects relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks is 
  estimated to be around -5.2% by 2030 and -13.6% by 2050, which is comparable to the 
  Hot House World scenarios. World GDP losses from physical risks vary in line with different 
  temperatures projected for each scenario. The impact on global GDP is dominated by physical risk. 
  Transition risk does not impact global GDP at 2030.

  [IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer. NiGEM NGFS v1.24[REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8].](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads) NiGEM NGFS v1.24.2 is not available for Low Demand scenario; Only chronic physical data available (not acute physical).

  Overall, these scenarios result in high physical risk including irreversible impacts like sea-level rise. 
  Transition risks are present however only from 2030 onwards, through domestic targets and 2050 transition strategies, 
  however, not enough to limit physical risk impacts.
