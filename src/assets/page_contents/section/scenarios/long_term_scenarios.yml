      ### Overview

      The long-term NGFS scenarios explore a range of transition and physical risks. These scenarios are generated by the Integrated 
      Assessment Models: GCAM 6.0, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM 2.0-M-R12 and REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8, as well as Climate Impact Explorer. The 
      macroeconomic outputs are generated by the National Institute Global Econometric Model (NiGEM) v1.24.2. 

      The NGFS long-term scenarios are detailed in the [NGFS scenario portal](https://www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal/) and summarised in the next pages. 
      The data used to create the graphs and charts shown in the reports are available [here]("/src/assets/data/chart_data.zip").

      ### Orderly scenarios

      The Orderly scenarios assume climate policies are introduced early and become gradually more stringent. Both physical and 
      transition risks are relatively subdued.

         - **Net Zero 2050** is an ambitious scenario that limits global warming to 1.5°C through stringent climate policies and 
         innovation, reaching global Net Zero CO2 emissions around 2050. This scenario assumes that ambitious climate policies and 
         technological shift are introduced immediately and forcefully impact the economy. 
         
         - **Below 2°C** gradually increases the stringency of climate policies, giving a 67% chance of limiting global warming to
         below 2°C.

         - **Low Demand** is a scenario in which strong energy demand reductions help to limit global warming to below 1.5°C in an
         orderly fashion. Low Demand stresses the importance of demand-side measures through more ambitious mitigation efforts i.e. 
         behavioural changes reflected in lower energy demand. The Delayed scenarios explore higher transition risk due to policies 
         being delayed or divergent across countries or sectors. For example, (shadow) carbon prices are typically higher for a given 
         temperature outcome.

      ### Disorderly scenario (Delayed Transition)

      The **Delayed Transition** scenario assumes annual emissions do not decrease until 2030. Strong policies and investments are 
      subsequently needed to limit warming to below 2°C. The level of commitments of countries depend on currently implemented 
      policies, leading to heterogeneity at the global level.

      # Long-Term Scenarios
      ### Hot House World scenarios

      The Hot house world scenarios assume that some climate policies are implemented in some jurisdictions, but globally efforts are
      insufficient to halt significant global warming, leading to high physical risk.

         - **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** includes all pledged targets even if not yet backed up by implemented 
         effective policies, leading to global temperature rise of 2.3°C.
         
         - **Current Policies** assumes that only currently implemented policies are preserved, leading to high physical risks. 
         Emissions grow leading to a global temperature rise of around 3°C. Investments allocation and energy mix do not change.

      # Long-Term Scenarios
      ### Too-little-too-late scenario (Fragmented World)

      The **Fragmented World** scenario assumes that late and uncoordinated transition fails to limit physical risks. This scenario 
      assumes delayed and divergent policy ambition globally, leading to high physical and transition risks. The Fragmented World 
      scenario explores adverse impacts if we fail to timely implement globally coordinated climate mitigation policies with 
      temperature rising by > 2°C. Climate policies and corresponding carbon prices vary wildly across geographies and sectors, 
      resulting in high transition risks on top of high physical risks.
