      # Short-Term Scenarios
      ## Overview

      The short-term scenarios explore the near-term impacts of climate-related risks from transition risk (i.e. climate policies) 
      and physical risk (i.e. extreme weather events). These scenarios are generated by the following models: 

         - **Macro-economic model** (GEM-E3), which projects how climate policies and physical risks impact the global economy. Key 
         outputs are carbon prices, emissions, and sectoral and regional macroeconomic projections (e.g. GDP, production, investment, 
         imports / exports, unemployment, electricity mix)

         - **Macro-financial model** (EIRIN) which takes carbon price projections and sectoral / regional economic impacts from GEM-E3 
         and physical risk impacts, and models how these shocks propagate through the financial system and broader economy. Examples of 
         outputs are CPI and policy rates.

         - **Financial risk model** (CLIMACRED), which uses GEM-E3’s sectoral / regional economic projections, EIRIN’s risk free rate 
         and physical risk impacts on capital to generate changes in asset values, interest rates, WACC and default probabilities as outputs.

         - **Physical climate model** (CLIMACRED, GEM-E3, EIRIN), The NGFS Short-Term Scenarios (STS) utilize a suite-of-models approach 
         to assess physical climate risks, focusing on near-term impacts. The primary models employed are CLIMACRED_PHYS which quantify 
         the climate impacts and those are used as an input to the macroeconomic model GEM-E3. To model the financial impact of the
         physical risks, EIRIN model produced outputs at sectoral level considering floods, storms, heatwave, wildfire and drought. 

      The NGFS short-term scenarios are summarised below. Full NGFS 2025 narratives and data used for the scenarios can be found in the [here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)

2:  
   name: Baseline scenario
   description: |
      # Short-Term Scenarios
      ## Baseline scenario

      The baseline scenario is calibrated using the October 2023 IMF World Economic Outlook projections and accounts for climate 
      targets pledged by January 2023 (e.g. Horizontal policies, including country-specific GHG emissions reduction targets or 
      carbon price targets). This baseline scenario is comparable to the long-term Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) 
      scenario. The NGFS variables used to illustrate impacts across the other short-term scenarios are presented as differences 
      from this baseline scenario.

3:  
   name: Highway to Paris (Transition Risk Scenario)
   description: |
      # Short-Term Scenarios
      ## Highway to Paris (Transition Risk Scenario)

      This scenario is Net Zero aligned and assume a rise in capital costs and risk premia for polluting sectors. It assumes a 
      gradual unfolding of technology-driven (and orderly) transition, where carbon tax revenues are reinvested into green 
      subsidies and investments. The table below summarise some of the potential impacts and implications to be considered.

      | Variable       | Potential impact    | Possible Implications & Considerations (non-exhaustive)   |
      |----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
      | Inflation      | Higher inflation, varies by geography      | Short-term increase driven by energy transition and infrastructure build-out; raises cost base. Global inflation is 0.93       percentage points (pp) higher in 2027 relative to baseline scenario.      |
      | Interest Rates | Higher interest rates, varies by geography      | Central banks respond to rising inflation, where world interest rates in 2027Q4 are 0.61pp higher compared to baseline scenario.    |
      | GDP Growth     | Volatile    | Economic activity slows due to adjustment costs and investment reallocation with a reduction of 0.3% of the World GDP impact at 2027 relative to the baseline scenario.     |
      | Carbon Prices  | Rapid and material increase    | In 2027, carbon prices are $45 per tonne CO2 (at 2017 prices) higher compared to baseline scenario. Improves risk-adjusted return outlook for green assets; Credit risk increases for high-emission companies / sectors.      |

4:  
   name: Sudden Wake-Up Call (Transition Risk Scenario)
   description: |
      # Short-Term Scenarios
      ## Sudden Wake-Up Call (Transition Risk Scenario)

      This scenario is Net Zero aligned and assume a rise in capital costs and risk premia for polluting sectors. It assumes a 
      sudden change in policy preferences after a period of widespread climate unawareness. Consumer and investor preferences 
      shift abruptly toward green sectors, and there is a supply shock triggered by a sharp surge in carbon prices. The transition 
      occurs too suddenly for markets to adapt, leading to a “Climate Minsky Moment” where asset values adjust abruptly, leading 
      to a wave of financial instability. The table below summarise some of the potential impacts and implications to be considered.

      | Variable       | Potential impact    | Possible Implications & Considerations (non-exhaustive)   |
      |----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
      | Inflation      | Significant inflation spikes, varies by geography      | Short-term spike (2027) in inflation driven by sudden energy transition and infrastructure build-out; raises cost base. Global inflation is 3.54pp higher in 2027 relative to baseline scenario.      |
      | Interest Rates | Higher interest rates, varies by geography      | Central banks respond to rising inflation, where world interest rates in 2027Q4 are 0.81pp higher compared to baseline scenario.    |
      | GDP Growth     | Negative impact, varies by geography    | GDP is impacted negatively across all regions, but with comparatively milder impacts in countries with ambitious climate policies in place. The global GDP contraction is estimated approximately to 1.2% at 2027 relative to the baseline scenario.     |
      | Carbon Prices  | Sudden and material increase    | Carbon price increases significantly in 2027, where world carbon price is $75 per tonne CO2 (at 2017 prices) higher compared to baseline scenario; improves risk-adjusted return outlook for green assets; credit risk increases for high-emission companies / sectors.      |

5:  
   name: Disaster and Policy Stagnation (Physical Risk Scenario)
   description: |
      # Short-Term Scenarios
      ## Disaster and Policy Stagnation (Physical Risk Scenario)

      This scenario assumes climate policy stagnation combined with the occurrence of a sequence of region-specific extreme 
      weather events occurring in 2026 and 2027 with international spillovers and compound shocks, as well as a rise in capital 
      costs and risk premia in sectors and countries exposed to physical risk. In practice, this results in distinct outcomes 
      for the six continental regions which are modelled separately, experiencing severe weather events in isolation, which then 
      translate to the rest of the world indirectly via trade and financial linkages. The table below summarise some of the 
      potential impacts and implications to be considered.

      | Variable       | Potential impact    | Possible Implications & Considerations (non-exhaustive)   |
      |----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
      | Inflation      | Higher inflation, varies by geography      | Driven by supply chain shocks, food and energy volatility, and post-disaster reconstruction; Increases cost base. World inflation rates are not available, however European inflation rates is noted to be 0.26pp higher in 2027 relative to baseline scenario.       |
      | Interest Rates | Varies by region      | Central banks’ responses range from tightening to accommodative or neutral, driven in part by the significant GDP gap created by this set of events. World interest rates are not available, however Europe interest rates in 2027Q4 are 0.06pp higher compared to baseline scenario.    |
      | GDP Growth     | Significantly lower, varies by geography    | Economic activity slows due to recurring physical damage and uncertainty. Reduced consumer spending. For example, GDP in the EU contracts by 3.3% in 2027 (deviation from baseline scenario) based on ‘own’ shocks.     |
      | Carbon Prices  | Flat or marginal increase    | Lack of strong carbon pricing weakens investment signals for green assets and raises long-term transition costs. For example, much of the world regions are not materially different to baseline carbon prices, and even Advanced Economies have lower carbon prices, i.e. in 2027, European carbon price is estimated to be $2.6 per tonne CO2 (at 2017 prices) lower compared to the global baseline scenario.      |

6:  
   name: Diverging Realities (Transition and Physical Risk Scenario)
   description: |
      # Short-Term Scenarios
      ## Diverging Realities (Transition and Physical Risk Scenario)

      This scenario assumes Net Zero alignment only in selected advanced economies (consistent with the Highway to Paris 
      scenario), and a sequence of region-specific disasters occurring in some regions of the world, with spillover 
      effects for advanced economies including through supply chain disruptions and increased cost in transition to a 
      low-carbon economy. The table below summarise some of the potential impacts and implications to be considered.

      | Variable       | Potential impact    | Possible Implications & Considerations (non-exhaustive)   |
      |----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
      | Inflation      | Higher inflation, varies by geography      | Regions affected by extreme dry events are initially subject to inflationary pressures stemming from higher production costs. Advanced economies implement transition policies and are affected by global supply constraints, which also leads to inflationary pressure. Global inflation is 0.52pp higher in 2027 relative to baseline scenario.      |
      | Interest Rates | Higher interest rates, varies by geography      | Central banks respond to rising inflation, where world interest rates in 2027Q4 are 0.54pp higher compared to baseline scenario.    |
      | GDP Growth     | Severe impact, varies by geography    | Global GDP is severely hit and does not recover within the scenario horizon, due to ongoing physical disasters. For example, world GDP contracts by 2.3% relative to baseline scenario at 2027.    |
      | Carbon Prices  | More gradual increase, varies by geography    | Transition risk remains unpriced in many markets, particularly those in emerging markets; Difficult to assess fair value of carbon-intensive assets. Globally, carbon prices at 2027 are $29 per tonne CO2 (at 2017 prices) higher compared to baseline scenario.      |

   name: Crosswalk between NGFS short- and long-term scenarios
   description: |
      # Short-Term Scenarios
      ## Crosswalk between NGFS short- and long-term scenarios

      NGFS short- and long-term scenarios should be compared with caution, as they explore different narratives and 
      employ different modelling frameworks. There are major differences between the two scenario that are highlighted 
      in our limitation section. 
      
      Nonetheless, we have provided an indicative crosswalk between the long-term and short-term scenarios below. 
      This approach is based on expert judgement and considers the following criteria:
      
       - Narrative storyline 
       - Emissions trajectory 
       - Policy ambition and coherence 
       - Macroeconomic and sectoral impacts 
       
      Given the inherent uncertainty when applying expert judgement to map short-term scenarios to the long-term, 
      we have, where possible, provided a ‘secondary match’ in addition to the ‘best match’ long-term scenario. 
      This reflects the fact that no one-to-one matches are applicable.

      | Short-term scenario       | Best Match long-term scenario   | Secondary Match long-term scenario   | Justification summary |
      |---------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
      | Highway to Paris      | Net Zero 2050 (Orderly)      | Low Demand (Orderly)      | NGFS highlights the comparability of Highway to Paris scenario with the Net Zero 2050 scenario. Early, ambitious, and coordinated policy implementation mirrors the orderly narrative of both Net Zero 2050 and Low Demand scenarios. |
      | Sudden Wake-Up Call | Delayed Transition (Disorderly)      | Fragmented World (Too-little-too-late)    | A three-year policy delay followed by abrupt action aligns with Delayed Transition’s policy shock and macro volatility. Fragmented World also reflects uncoordinated disruption. |
      | Diverging Realities     | Fragmented World (Too-little-too-late)    | N/A    | Supply chain disruption, regional fragmentation, and inflated transition costs align with the narrative and emissions of Fragmented World. Acute physical risk crystallizes. |
      | Disasters and Policy Stagnation  | Current Policies (Hot House World)    | N/A      | A pure physical risk scenario with no new policy ambition tracks closest to the Current Policies scenario. Acute physical risk crystallizes. |

      # Short-Term Scenarios
      ## Example of some questions to consider by sector

      # Financial Services
      
      The four short-term scenarios can be used to support several use cases for financial firms including 
      strategy, risk management, business planning, pricing as well as Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) 
      for banks and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) for insurers. The impacts on financial firms are 
      primarily transmitted through their counterparties, companies they lend to, invest in, insure, or whose 
      assets they manage. The extent of this impact varies based on their business model, regions in which they 
      operate in and the industries/sectors that they provide financial services to.
    
      **Highway to Paris** 
      
      Financial firms that are heavily exposed to carbon-intensive sectors may face elevated transition risk 
      compared to those that are aligned with a net zero trajectory. For example, in this short-term scenario 
      we could see a more limited impact compared to other scenarios with a reduction of up to 0.5% of the 
      World GDP and a +0.7pp rise in unemployment. The probability of default for coal is projected by NGFS 
      to increase by approximately 35% by 2030 relative to the baseline, while it is projected to reduce for 
      green transition sectors (e.g. up to 8% reduction by 2030 for wind). For further details see the NGFS 
      documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:
      
      - How is this scenario relevant to the financial firm? What are the key short-term variables (e.g. carbon 
      price, energy demand, inflation, interest rates, GDP)?

      - How could this scenario affect the business planning and the resilience of the strategy? Are the 
      underlying assumptions in this scenario consistent with those used for risk management and business planning?

      - What is the financial firm exposure to sectors likely to face declining demand or regulatory tightening 
      (e.g. oil & gas, coal, high-emission manufacturing)?

      - How fast can the financial firm reallocate capital away from high-emission sectors particularly those that 
      are illiquid (e.g. infrastructure investments in oil & gas)?

      - Is the financial firm well positioned to benefit from growth in green sectors (e.g. renewable energy, 
      sustainable agriculture, low-carbon transport)?

      - What are the key management actions of the financial firm identified as part of this exercise 
      (e.g. enhance existing product offerings to respond to evolving customer sustainability needs)?

      **Sudden Wake-Up Call**

      Due to lower carbon revenue recycling in this scenario compared to the Highway to Paris, the 
      expectation is that a larger portion of the required funding must be raised by the private sector.
      Combined with a more restrictive monetary policy environment, this ultimately leads to higher 
      associated capital costs. The abrupt policy implementation in 2027 results in a projected spike in 
      inflation (e.g. +3pp in the EU), a global GDP contraction of approximately 1.2%, and a rise in 
      unemployment by around 1.3pp. The probability of default for coal sectors is projected by NGFS to 
      remain flat until 2026 and then rise sharply by 35% to 40% by 2030, while the probability of default 
      for wind sectors is projected to remain flat. For further details see the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).

      **Key questions**:

      - How is this scenario relevant to the financial firm? What are the key short-term variables 
      (e.g. carbon price, energy demand, inflation, interest rates, GDP)? 

      - How could this scenario affect the business planning and the resilience of the strategy and 
      what is the impact on capital? Are the underlying assumptions in this scenario consistent 
      with those used for risk management and business planning?

      - What is the financial firm exposure to sectors which could be significantly impacted 
      by a sudden decrease in demand or regulatory tightening (e.g. oil & gas, coal, high-emission
         manufacturing)?

      - Is the financial firm well positioned to capture opportunities in green sectors such as 
      renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, or low-carbon transport?

      - What are the key management actions of the financial firm identified as part of this 
      exercise (e.g. enhance existing product offerings to respond to sudden changes to 
      customer sustainability needs)?
      
      **Disasters and Policy Stagnation**
      
      In this scenario, weather events (e.g. wildfires, floods, storms) raise financial risk 
      across sectors due to production losses and capital destruction. The compound and extreme 
      weather events significantly impact economic growth in the year of the shocks, followed by 
      a slow recovery in the years that follow. For example, GDP in the EU contracts by 4.8% in 2026 
      and 3.3% in 2027 based on ‘own’ shocks. In addition, the probability of default is projected by
      NGFS to increase above 10% in 2027 compared to the baseline across wind, PV, power supply and 
      gas driven by wet physical risk events. For further details see the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:

      - How is this scenario relevant to the financial firm? What are the key short-term variables 
      (e.g. physical impacts broken down by hazard, inflation, interest rates, GDP)? 

      - How could this scenario affect the business planning and the resilience of the strategy and 
      what is the impact on capital? Are the underlying assumptions in this scenario consistent 
      with those used for risk management and business planning?

      - What is the financial firm exposure to sectors (e.g. agriculture, real estate) and 
      geographies with heightened physical risks?

      - Is the financial firm well-positioned to finance or invest in adaptation solutions 
      (e.g. resilient infrastructure, climate-smart agriculture)?

      - What are the key management actions of the financial firm identified as part of this
      exercise (e.g. increased engagement activity focussed on adaptation solutions at investee 
      companies)?

      **Diverging Realities**
      
      In this scenario, a sequence of adverse weather events (e.g. wildfires, floods, storms) occurring 
      regionally and primarily in Africa, South America and Asia raise financial risks across sectors 
      due to production losses and capital destruction. Although less pronounced, we expect carbon-intensive 
      sectors in advanced economies to experience sizeable impacts due to bearing the cost of the green 
      transition and additional supply chain interruptions in critical raw materials. For example, 
      regional disasters hitting specific regions result in a 6.4% GDP contraction in Africa (2030) which 
      affect the world economy through trade and financial linkages and results in a 1.7% GDP contraction 
      in EU (2030); overall World GDP contracts by 2.5% by 2030 and unemployment increasing by 1.6pp. 
      In addition, the probability of default for coal is projected by NGFS to increase by close to 15% 
      compared to the baseline in 2030, while the probability of default for wind decreases by around 5%. 
      For further details see the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:

      - How is this scenario relevant to the financial firm? What are the key short-term variables 
      (e.g. physical impacts broken down by hazard, carbon price, inflation, interest rates, GDP)? 

      - How could this scenario affect the business planning and the resilience of the strategy 
      and what is the impact on capital? Are the underlying assumptions in this scenario consistent 
      with those used for risk management and business planning?

      - What is the financial firm exposure to sectors (e.g. agriculture, real estate, transport) 
      and geographies with heightened physical and transition risks?

      - Is the financial firm well-positioned to capture opportunities in green sectors and/or 
      adaptation solutions (e.g. resilient infrastructure, sustainable agriculture)?

      - What are the key management actions of the financial firm identified as part of this 
      exercise (e.g. introduction of product offering targeted at regions where this is 
      increased preference and demand for sustainability-related products)?

      # Manufacturing
      
      Manufacturing is heterogeneous, spanning energy-intensive heavy industry, consumer goods and 
      green-technology supply chains. Its climate-risk profile therefore hinges on carbon intensity, 
      capital stock age and exposure to physical supply-chain disruption.

      **Highway to Paris**
      
      In this scenario, carbon prices escalate smoothly and are recycled into green investments, 
      driving moderate declines in output for high-emission subsectors (e.g., non-ferrous metals) 
      but gains for producers of low-carbon equipment. This scenario assumes relative declines in 
      baseline output for carbon-intensive manufacturing (e.g. -8% for non-EV transport equipment 
      by 2030), offset by double-digit growth in batteries and renewable-equipment lines. Probability 
      of default rises by 1-3 pp in brown-industry firms (e.g. chemicals, ferrous and non-ferrous 
      metals, non-EV transport equipment, etc.) but falls for green manufacturers. For further 
      details see the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).

      **Key questions**:

      - How carbon-intensive is the current production mix across plants and product lines?

      - Are capital-expenditure plans aligned with the orderly carbon-price glide-path?

      - How ready are facilities to deploy energy-efficiency upgrades and switch to clean power?

      - Can the firm pivot to supplying the green transition (e-mobility, heat-pump parts, 
      wind-turbine castings)?

      **Sudden Wake-Up Call**

      The 2027 “climate Minsky moment” triggers a sharp carbon-price jump without matching subsidies. 
      Heavy manufacturing faces double-digit output losses. Transport-equipment (non-EV) output is 
      down by 10% in relation to the baseline by 2030. Capital-intensive plants become stranded while 
      green-tech lines cannot ramp up fast enough. PDs for brown manufacturing climb by 2-4 pp, and 
      cost of capital spikes as monetary policy tightens. For further details see the NGFS 
      documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:

      - What is the stranded-asset risk in long-lived kilns, furnaces or other high-emission equipment?

      - Does sufficient liquidity exist to absorb soaring carbon and energy costs during the policy shock?

      - How quickly can key facilities retrofit or exit under abrupt regulation?

      - Could a sustained decline in demand downstream propagate upstream via cancelled orders? 
      For example, raised energy-efficiency standards for heating rendering the manufacture of 
      certain boilers obsolete 

      **Disasters and Policy Stagnation** 
      
      In conjunction with policy stagnation, a sequence of extreme weather events destroys infrastructure 
      and disrupts businesses. Floods and storms damage factories and logistics, especially in Europe’s 
      2026-27 storyline. European modelling shows PD increasing by 5 pp in manufacturing areas such as 
      rubber, plastic and paper products. Capital-intensive subsectors bear additional financial amplification 
      while insurance premia and repair costs erode margins. For further details see the NGFS 
      documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:

      - Where are factories, warehouses and critical suppliers located relative to floodplains, 
      storm tracks or heat hotspots?

      - What single-point-of-failure risks exist in just-in-time supply chains, and are buffer 
      inventories available?

      - Which facilities require physical adaptations such as flood-proofing or additional cooling?

      - How will higher insurance premiums and physical-risk surcharges (e.g. facing higher 
      borrowing costs due to exposure and management of physical risks) affect project hurdle rates? 

      **Diverging Realities**

      Advanced economies push ahead with carbon pricing, while emerging regions endure disasters that 
      choke supplies of critical minerals and components. NGFS finds battery and PV-panel exports 
      fall 25–30 % in relation to the baseline at the peak of the supply stress. Green-tech manufacturers 
      in the global north face input shortages, driving up costs. Brown manufacturing elsewhere suffers 
      from both disasters and lost demand. Global PDs rise 3-4 pp for sectors vulnerable to supply chain 
      disruptions, e.g. rubber and plastic and non-EV transport equipment. For further details see the 
      NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).

      **Key questions**:

      - How exposed are operations to critical-mineral supply chains (cobalt, nickel, rare earths) 
      vulnerable to climate shocks?

      - What competitive advantage exists for on-shoring or friend-shoring production under 
      diverging policies?

      - Is the balance sheet resilient to simultaneous transition-compliance costs and 
      supply-chain inflation?

      - How will higher working-capital needs be funded in a tighter monetary environment?

      # Agriculture
      
      For agriculture, the transmission channels differ across the four narratives. The sector is affected directly 
      through changes in yields, productivity and asset destruction, and indirectly via trade, input prices, finance 
      costs and shifting food demand. The NGFS short-term narratives show that, within just one business cycle, a 
      mixture of carbon-price shocks, extreme weather and supply-chain disruption can swing farm-gate margins, 
      asset values and credit risk far more violently than the slow-moving structural trends captured in most long-run models. 

      **Highway to Paris**

      In this scenario, revenues from gradually rising global carbon prices are recycled into green subsidies 
      and R&D. Although agriculture is not the major emitting sector, it still emits a large proportion (globally) 
      of greenhouse gases and faces higher input costs (energy, fertiliser) and tighter land-use regulations, 
      while simultaneously benefitting from more funding for climate-smart practices. NGFS modelling shows that
      default probabilities for agriculture slightly slipping below the baselne (<-1 pp by 2030) because supportive 
      policies and better climate outcomes offset higher costs. Production volumes initially dip but recover as 
      efficiency gains take hold. For further details see the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).                                    
      
      **Key questions**:

      - How resilient are farm production systems to a rising carbon price and stricter land-use standards?

      - What is the exposure to energy-intensive inputs such as fuel and fertiliser?

      - Do business models already embed low-emission practices (e.g., precision irrigation, soil-carbon credits)?
      
      - Can the business capture upside from climate-smart subsidies and growing demand for certified sustainable produce?

      **Sudden Wake-Up Call**

      In this scenario the world delays action until 2027 and then unleashes a sharp carbon-price shock with only 
      partial governmental revenue recycling used to support the transition. Energy and input costs soar just as 
      central banks keep policy rates restrictive. Agricultural PDs rise only modestly—less than 1 pp by 2030—remaining 
      well below double-digit jumps seen in heavy-industry sectors. Liquidity pressure nonetheless intensifies as 
      monetary policy tightens, pushing up the cost of capital. Livestock and dairy operators, which are more methane-intensive, 
      are to see the largest risk premia yet comparatively less impacted than other sectors. For further details 
      see the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:

      - Can farms withstand an abrupt cost squeeze if carbon levies triple within the short period of initial carbon price shock years?

      - What liquidity buffer and debt‐maturity profile exist to absorb higher input costs?

      - How quickly can production shift to low-methane and low-nitrogen practices?

      - Will processors and retailers be able to pass through higher farm-gate prices without destroying demand?

      **Disasters and Policy Stagnation** 

      This scenario layers back-to-back “dry” (drought, heatwave, wildfire) and “wet” (flood, storm) events in 2026–27. 
      Agriculture is explicitly identified as the hardest hit financially. World-wide, agriculture sees a cost-of-capital 
      rise of up to 6%. The average probability of default within the agriculture sector increases above baseline by 10.7pp 
      in the “dry” events year and 2.7 pp in the “wet” events years, dwarfing other industries. Export losses ripple through 
      global food markets, pushing up volatility in commodity prices. Staple-price inflation spills over globally, forcing 
      additional monetary tightening that further constrains rural credit. For further details see the 
      NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:

      - How robust are assets and supply chains to compound climate shocks such as floods and droughts?

      - Where are the most climate-vulnerable land holdings or loans concentrated geographically?

      - Are contingency plans in place for simultaneous crop failures in multiple regions?

      - Can the business finance or insure adaptation measures like irrigation expansion or heat-resilient cultivars?

      **Diverging Realities** 

      OECD countries glide along an HTP-style transition, but Asia, South America and Africa endure sequential 
      heatwaves, droughts and floods from 2025 onward. Supply chain disruptions in critical raw materials, including 
      agriculture products, create spillover effects for Advanced Economies. The probability of default within 
      the agriculture sector increases up to 25 pp for some South American countries, and 0.7 pp for the global 
      average. Temperate-zone exporters enjoy price windfalls yet face input shortages and non-tariff barriers 
      as importing nations scramble for staples. For further details see the NGFS 
      documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:

      - How resilient is the business to stricter transition rules at home combined with climate shocks abroad?

      - What is the exposure to imported feed, fertiliser and labour from disaster-hit regions?

      - Can producers monetise higher prices while still meeting new sustainability standards?

      - Is concessional finance available for resilience technologies such as drought-tolerant seeds or on-farm renewables?

      # Construction
      
      The construction sector comprises establishments primarily responsible for the construction of buildings 
      including new works, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. From a transition risk perspective, 
      the sector could face rising operating costs as carbon pricing policies increase building material and energy 
      prices; while from a physical risk perspective, disruptions to the construction process and impacts on productivity 
      due to extreme climate events and rising temperatures will be a key factor.

      **Highway to Paris**

      In this scenario, the impacts on the construction industry will primarily be associated with the regulatory and 
      economic pressures from the transition to a green economy and race to Net Zero. Construction firms face steady 
      rising costs from carbon pricing, especially for materials like cement and steel, and the risk of asset obsolescence 
      as regulations tighten (e.g. regulations mandating green building certifications such as A rated EPC / Excellent 
      BREEAM). However, as ambitious policies are implemented in an orderly manner, transition risk generates only a 
      limited GDP impact across countries (-0.5%) and a moderate rise in unemployment (+0.7pp). Carbon tax revenues are 
      recycled into the green transition, leading to a rise in investments, though sectoral output changes for the 
      construction sector are limited in the Highway to Paris scenario (less than 0.5%). For further details see the 
      NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:

      - How resilient are construction firms to the rising costs of carbon pricing, especially for 
      materials like cement and steel? 

      - What is the construction firm exposure to assets at risk of obsolescence due to regulatory 
      tightening (e.g. regulations mandating green building certifications such as A rated EPC / Excellent BREEAM)?

      - Does the business already embed low-emission practices / materials in their business model 
      (e.g. low-carbon concrete, modular construction, and digital twin of the physical construction 
      using advanced simulation models)?

      - Can the business capture the upside from climate-smart subsidies and growing demand for 
      A rated EPC / Excellent BREEAM green building certifications?

      **Sudden Wake-Up Call**

      In this scenario, the impacts on the construction industry will primarily be associated with the regulatory 
      nd economic pressures from the transition to a green economy and race to Net Zero. Construction firms face 
      a delayed and sudden rise in costs from carbon pricing, especially for materials like cement and steel, and 
      the risk of asset obsolescence as regulations tighten (e.g. regulations mandating green building certifications 
      such as A rated EPC / Excellent BREEAM). As abrupt and disorderly policy shifts are implemented and increase 
      economic costs, transition risk leads to a 1.3% GDP decline and a 1.3pp rise in unemployment rate in 2030. 
      Carbon tax revenues are only partially recycled into the green transition, leading to a partial decline in 
      investments, affecting sectoral output changes for the construction sector (-1%). For further details see 
      the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:

      - How resilient are construction firms to the sudden shock rise in carbon pricing, especially for materials 
      like cement and steel? 

      - Does the construction firm have a strategic plan in place in case of sudden shift and obsolescence of assets 
      due to regulatory tightening (e.g. regulations mandating green building certifications such as A rated EPC / Excellent BREEAM)?

      - Can the business quickly embed low-emission practices / materials in their business model (e.g. low-carbon 
      concrete, modular construction, and digital twin of the physical construction using advanced simulation models)?

      - Will the firm client base (e.g. real estate buyers or investors) be able to absorb the sudden increase in 
      price for buildings with green building certifications (e.g. A rated EPC / Excellent BREEAM)?

      **Disasters and Policy Stagnation** 

      In this scenario, the impacts on the construction industry will primarily be associated with the location 
      of the assets and geographies most affected by the extreme weather events. In this scenario, weather events 
      e.g. wildfires, floods, storms) raise risk of asset stranding across geographies, caused by building destruction 
      and operational disruptions. The compound and extreme weather events significantly impact economic growth in 
      the year of the shocks, followed by a slow recovery in the years that follow. 

      For example, EU GDP contracts by 4.8% in 2026 and 3.3% in 2027 based on ‘own’ shocks. In addition, the lower 
      economic activity leads to a decline in investments with a partial recovery after 2027, and sectoral output 
      production in construction is heavily affected by the physical asset destruction and lower productivity levels, 
      leading to a decrease from baseline of 3.5% by 2030. For further details see the NGFS 
      documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:

      - How reliant is the firm on climate-vulnerable markets and locations that may see reduced demand due 
      to heightened physical risks? 

      - What single-point-of-failure risks exist in assets and supply chains, and are buffer inventories available? 

      - Are contingency plans in place for disruptions and delays in the construction process due to first 
      order (e.g. cyclones, heat stress) and second order (e.g. damage to infrastructure and equipment) impacts?

      - Is the firm well-positioned to invest in adaptation solutions (e.g. resilient materials, equipment 
      and infrastructure)?

      **Diverging Realities** 

      In this scenario, the impacts on the construction industry will be associated with both the regulatory and 
      economic pressures from the transition to a green economy and race to Net Zero, as well as the location of 
      the assets and geographies most affected by the extreme weather events. In this scenario, weather events 
      (e.g. wildfires, floods, storms) raise risk of asset stranding in certain geographies, primarily Africa, 
      South America and Asia, caused by building destruction and operational disruptions. Other geographies see a 
      rise in costs from carbon pricing, especially for materials like cement and steel, and the risk of asset 
      obsolescence as regulations tighten (e.g. regulations mandating green building certifications such as 
      A rated EPC / Excellent BREEAM). 

      For example, regional disasters hitting specific regions affect the world economy through trade and financial 
      linkages with the World GDP contracting by 2.5% by 2030 and unemployment increasing by 1.6pp. In addition, the 
      lower economic activity leads to a decline in investments with long-lasting effects, and sectoral output production 
      in construction is affected by the physical asset destruction and lower productivity levels, as well as the 
      transition of certain economies to green investments, leading to a decrease from baseline of around 3.4% by 2030. 
      For further details see the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).

      **Key questions**:

      - Is the balance sheet resilient to simultaneous transition-compliance costs and supply-chain inflation?

      - What is the exposure to imported materials, machinery and equipment from climate-vulnerable regions?

      - Are contingency plans in place for simultaneous delays and disruptions in multiple locations?

      - Is concessional finance available for resilience technologies such as flood-resistant material or early-detection disaster smart meters?

      # Energy Underwriting
      
      Energy Underwriting under the NGFS Short-Term Scenarios reflects heightened near-term volatility driven by both 
      physical and transition risks. Transition risks may emerge abruptly due to regulatory uncertainty, litigation trends, 
      or investment withdrawals from carbon-intensive assets. Physical risks such as extreme heat, storms, or flooding can 
      disrupt construction, delay renewable project deployment, or damage existing infrastructure. Underwriters must rapidly 
      adapt pricing, exclusions, and treaty terms to reflect changing short-term exposure profiles across fossil and renewable 
      energy systems.

      **Highway to Paris**

      In this scenario, energy underwriters face heightened liability exposures, particularly concerning directors 
      and officers (D&O) insurance, as companies adjust to smooth but escalating carbon prices, rigorous emissions 
      standards, and comprehensive disclosure mandates. On the positive side, carbon tax revenue recycling increases 
      green investments and benefit firms expanding into renewable energy including the potential to support infrastructure 
      resilience through innovative insurance solutions. By 2030, energy production from green technologies reach $1.8 trillion 
      (twice the size of the baseline scenario), and this growth helps limit global GDP losses to -0.5% (relative to baseline) 
      at 2030. For further details see the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).

      **Key questions**:

      - How exposed are insured fossil fuel projects to early policy tightening, such as accelerated carbon pricing, 
      phase-out schedules, or emission caps?

      - Do underwriting guidelines reflect the growing risk of project cancellation or delay-in-start-up for carbon-intensive 
      energy infrastructure in light of stricter approval and permitting processes?

      - How well are underwriting portfolios diversified toward low-carbon energy projects, such as grid-scale renewables, 
      storage, or green hydrogen, which may benefit from policy incentives?

      - Are liability products (e.g. D&O, environmental liability) sufficiently calibrated for the increasing litigation 
      and regulatory enforcement risks in the energy sector?

      - Can treaty or facultative reinsurance structures absorb the short-term volatility in claims linked to rapid transition 
      shifts, such as regulatory breaches, stranded asset write-downs, or abandoned construction?

      **Sudden Wake-Up Call**

      In this scenario, energy underwriting is affected by a delayed and abrupt implementation of aggressive carbon pricing, 
      phase-out mandates, and stricter emissions controls. Insured entities in fossil fuel exploration, refining, and thermal 
      generation face heightened risk of asset stranding, contract renegotiation, or forced shutdowns, leading to increased 
      claims volatility and tightening of cover for construction all-risk and business interruption products. 

      These shocks are compounded by increased litigation risk for legacy high-emissions portfolios, with D&O and environmental 
      liability lines particularly exposed. Renewable energy developers also experience stress due to inflationary pressure on 
      materials, workforce shortages, and regulatory bottlenecks, limiting the expected upside. Disorderly scenario dynamics 
      therefore result in a sharper macroeconomic impact (GDP -1.3%, unemployment +1.3pp by 2030) compared to Highway to Paris, 
      further stressing insurance balance sheets. Reinsurance treaties may require repricing or exclusions to reflect higher 
      uncertainty and compressed timelines for decarbonisation. For further details see the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).

      **Key questions**:

      - How exposed are insured energy clients to abrupt carbon pricing shocks or forced asset phase-outs due to delayed 
      but aggressive policy tightening?

      - Do energy underwriting portfolios include fossil projects vulnerable to regulatory cancellation, contract disruption, 
      or unplanned asset decommissioning?

      - Are underwriting terms and exclusions adapted for sudden increases in D&O or environmental liability risks due to 
      litigation and non-compliance with late-stage climate regulations?

      - Can renewable or transitional energy projects (e.g. hydrogen, CCS) withstand sudden shifts in financing conditions, 
      permitting regimes, or technology standards introduced under time pressure?

      - Is the firm’s reinsurance strategy resilient to a spike in correlated claims across legacy energy exposures, construction 
      delays, and stranded asset risks?

      **Disasters and Policy Stagnation**

      In this scenario, the energy underwriting sector is predominantly affected by escalating physical climate risks in the 
      absence of meaningful policy response. Compound and extreme weather events—such as hurricanes, heatwaves, floods, and 
      wildfires—cause widespread operational disruption, asset damage, and increased downtime across both fossil and renewable 
      energy infrastructure. Power plants, offshore rigs, pipelines, substations, and grid networks in vulnerable geographies 
      face growing exposure to acute hazard events, driving up claims in property, business interruption, and construction all-risk lines.

      The shocks also affect new energy developments, particularly in areas with weaker resilience standards or limited emergency 
      response capacity. Rising loss ratios may lead to withdrawal of underwriting capacity in high-risk zones, while chronic 
      physical risks (e.g. sea-level rise, heat stress) begin to influence long-term asset valuation assumptions and project 
      insurability. Economically, sharp GDP contractions (e.g. EU GDP -4.8% in 2026, -3.3% in 2027) and weak investment recovery 
      post-disaster reduce energy sector capital spending, narrowing growth in insurable opportunities. For further details 
      see the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).
      
      **Key questions**:

      - How concentrated is the underwriting portfolio in climate-vulnerable geographies where extreme weather events 
      (e.g. floods, wildfires, hurricanes) are expected to increase in intensity and frequency?

      - Do insured energy assets—such as power plants, pipelines, or offshore infrastructure—have single points of 
      failure that could lead to cascading physical and financial losses during compound weather events?

      - Are insured entities equipped with robust contingency and recovery plans to manage acute physical shocks 
      (e.g. cyclone-driven outages, damage to transmission infrastructure, or substation failures)?

      - Can underwriting models adequately account for second-order risks such as labour shortages, equipment damage, 
      or delays caused by the knock-on effects of extreme climate events?

      - Are clients in a financial or operational position to invest in resilience upgrades (e.g. elevation, flood 
      defence, fire protection), and is cover conditional on such adaptation measures?

      **Diverging Realities**

      In this scenario, energy underwriting is shaped by uneven global climate responses and increasingly divergent exposures 
      to physical and transition risks. Some regions—primarily advanced economies—begin to implement carbon pricing and regulatory 
      reforms, creating transition pressures on fossil-heavy energy projects and technologies. Underwriters operating in these 
      jurisdictions face rising liability, cancellation, and delay-in-start-up risks linked to changing regulatory standards, 
      shifting capital flows, and evolving insurability conditions for high-emitting assets.

      In contrast, many emerging economies continue to face underinvestment in climate resilience and mitigation. As a result, 
      energy infrastructure in parts of Africa, South America, and Asia becomes increasingly exposed to extreme weather events 
      such as flooding, wildfires, and heatwaves—driving up claims from physical damage and business interruption, particularly 
      for thermal generation and grid infrastructure. Regional disasters trigger systemic ripple effects via commodity markets 
      and energy trade flows, contributing to macroeconomic instability (e.g. global GDP contracts by 2.5% by 2030; unemployment 
      rises by 1.6pp). Prolonged uncertainty leads to a pullback in cross-border energy investment, with insurers reassessing 
      geographic and project-level exposure limits. For further details see the NGFS documentation ([here](https://www.ngfs.net/en/publications-and-statistics/publications/ngfs-short-term-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors)).

      **Key questions**:

      - Is the underwriting portfolio resilient to the dual impact of tightening transition regulations in some markets and 
      escalating physical risks in others?

      - What is the exposure to insured energy assets or supply chains that depend on components (e.g. turbines, cables, 
      transformers) imported from climate-vulnerable or politically unstable regions?

      - Are clients equipped with contingency plans for simultaneous operational disruptions due to extreme weather events 
      and sudden shifts in local policy environments?

      - Can underwritten entities access concessional or blended finance to invest in physical adaptation measures 
      (e.g. storm-resilient substations, grid hardening, offshore anchoring technologies)?

      - Are underwriting models adapted to reflect widening regional disparities in transition speed, litigation risk, 
      and physical risk accumulation across global energy markets?
