    This tool may be useful for climate reporting and risk assessments. However, a limitation for those seeking to embed 
    climate-related risks and opportunities into their risk management framework and investment decision making is that it does 
    not specify a baseline related directly to what is priced into assets today. It also does not allow for meaningful variation 
    in the implementation of climate policies across geographies and sectors, nor alternative technology pathways. 

    Similarly, the tool does not provide a mechanism to test how financial exposures may differ if the solar friendly technology 
    pathways of the REMIND model do not come to pass. Relaxing these policy and technology universality assumptions will naturally 
    generate quite different assessments of the climate exposures of different financial securities and assets.

    In addition, for the purposes of this tool, NiGEM calculated Carbon Prices have been used, with REMIND-MAgPIE inputs. This is 
    as opposed to the REMIND-MAgPIE carbon prices that directly model the energy changes. This was done for consistency across the 
    countries assessed, as the REMIND-MAgPIE model is split into 12 regions and carbon policy modelling is uniform within those 
    regions. Whilst the NiGEM Carbon Prices are not in use by the model, they are indicators of the transition ambition of 
    sovereigns under different climate transition scenarios, and as they are themselves abstractions of climate policy, they are 
    displayed throughout for sovereigns. REMIND-MAgPIE allows for carbon prices to be available for the US, China, India, and 
    Japan, as well as the European Union, without any need for downscaling for these entities.

    The NGFS Phase V long-term scenarios have several limitations that should be carefully considered, for example:
    - The scenarios are neither a forecast of what is likely to happen nor a description of what should happen, but an 
    illustration of what could happen (this does include some adverse scenarios, however the global spike in energy prices in 
    2022, due in part  to the war in Ukraine, was both more adverse and more immediate than any of the scenarios designed ex ante 
    - the NGFS published a note to demonstrate the relevance of the NGFS scenarios to this situation). The NGFS scenarios are 
    underpinned by a subset of models, e.g. REMIND, GCAM and MESSAGE, which make some assumptions about long-term technology 
    pathways that are of course highly uncertain. Such models also assume smooth adjustment processes and largely proxy climate 
    policy through carbon pricing. 

    - The scenarios rely on simplified assumptions about future policies, technologies, and economic developments, which do not 
    fully capture the complexities of real-world transitions as well as the complex interconnectivity of risks. For example, there 
    is limited consideration of incentives to lower solely non-CO2 emissions (e.g., methane) which would be pertinent levers for 
    sectors such as livestock farming and energy; the global transition investment exceeded $2 Trillion for the First Time in 2024 
    – ahead of NGFS scenarios by 5 years.

    - NiGEM, used for understanding the macroeconomic impacts as a response to the different transition pathways, is a 
    Global Semi-structural Macro-econometric Policy Model. These models excel in 
    understanding the wider macroeconomic response, but are not designed to model intra-group competition, inequalities, or 
    variation, and extra caution is advised in examining individual companies or sovereigns modelled within a group.

    - Sovereigns are split in their modelling between “Full Country” economic models, “Reduced Country Models”, and “Regional 
    Block” models. As such, certain nations (including Brazil and India) are modelled at the reduced level (they lack a modelled 
    government sector that must strike any balance between tax revenues and spending and use a simplified model for primary energy 
    production).

    - They do not fully account for physical impacts, including tipping points and compound risks. For example, acute impacts have 
    not been refreshed since Phase IV and certain relevant and material acute physical risks remain 
    un-modelled as only four acute physical impacts are modelled using one transmission channel (flood and cyclones through 
    capital asset damages; droughts through crop yield losses; heatwaves through labour productivity decline). Please refer to [CFRF Seassion 5 outputs](https://www.fca.org.uk/cfrf)
    namely the UK Physical Risk Benchmarking Exercise and the 2025 CFRF Adaptation paper for more information. 

    - The societal impacts, such as climate-induced migration, are not thoroughly considered and are assumed to be the same across
    these scenarios.

    - The Orderly Below 2°C scenario generates a common carbon price for the global power and transportation sectors. Whereas in 
    the Net Zero 2050 scenario there are regional differences in carbon price, and in the Fragmented World scenario there are 
    sectoral differences in carbon price, as well as between, say EU and US and China.

    - There is significant uncertainty about future technology developments and government policy changes, which can affect the 
    accuracy of the scenarios.

    - The climate scenarios focus on a plausible range of outcomes for given emissions or temperature pathways 
    rather than the tail events or extreme outcomes such as tipping points. For further information please see the paper produced by the Institute of Actuaries
