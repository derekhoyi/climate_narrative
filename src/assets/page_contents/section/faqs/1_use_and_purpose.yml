use and purpose:  
  - question: What is the purpose of the tool? 
    answer: |
        This online climate scenario analysis tool is designed to support financial services firms in assessing their climate-related 
        risks and opportunities. The tool summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for banks, insurers and 
        asset managers based on the business activities, products, or risks of the firm and the materiality of different lending 
        exposure types, underwriting classes, asset classes, and economic sectors for the firm. For more information, please refer to 
        [Purpose: Overview] (/purpose)

  - question: How can the reports generated by the tool be used?
    answer: |
        The information provided by the online climate scenario analysis tool and its associated reports aims to help financial 
        services firms better understand their potential financial exposures to climate change. This information could help them to 
        start considering climate-related risks and opportunities within their governance, strategy, risk management and reporting 
        under the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosuresâ€™ (TCFD) recommendations or support their climate transition 
        plans. For more information, please refer to [Purpose: How can the reports be used?](purpose/how-can-the-reports-be-used)

  - question: What audience is the tool targeted for? 
    answer: |
        The online climate scenario analysis tool is targeted to support financial services firms in assessing their climate-related 
        risks and opportunities, using scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) as a base. These 
        scenarios were primarily developed for central banks and supervisors, but they provide a useful reference point for other 
        financial institutions, including banks, asset managers and insurers, when evaluating the impacts of climate-related risk to 
        their business.

  - question: What limitations should I be aware of when using the tool?
    answer: |
        There are a number of uncertainties and limitations associated with the tool. The tool is based on NGFS Phase V long-term 
        scenarios (November 2024) and only signposts to NGFS short-term scenarios (May 2025). The scenarios underpinned by this tool 
        are not forecasts but rather plausible pathways designed to help financial institutions explore the potential range of 
        outcomes and build resilience. For more information on limitations of the long-term scenarios narratives, please refer to 
        [Limitations: Long-term scenarios](limitations/long-term-scenario-limitations), while for limitations of the short-term scenarios narratives, 
        please refer to [Limitations: Short-term scenarios](limitations/short-term-scenario-limitations)
