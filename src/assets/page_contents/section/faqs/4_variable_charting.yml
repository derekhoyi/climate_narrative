  - question: How are the indicators split for charting? 
    answer: |
        The indicators for charting are split by the physical risk and the transition risk categories. E.g., economic damages from 
        flood are captured under ‘physical risk’; carbon price is captured under ‘transition risk’. GDP is a unique case that is 
        captured under ‘transition risk’ however is reported for both the impacts combined, by transition and by physical (chronic) 
        risk (see separate FAQ question on GDP impacts). The variable charting tool acts as a filter, beginning with the selection of 
        either physical or transition risk, therefore if variables are subsequently unavailable, this implies that datapoint for that 
        selection is not present in the underlying dataset.


  - question: What regions are represented within the datasets for variable charting?
    answer: |    
        Data for UK is only available for physical risk variables. World and other granular countries are available for transition 
        risk variables (namely for the sovereign countries within the tool). Region is the secondary filter, i.e., where indicators 
        are not available for specific countries, this implies that the country data for that selection is not present. 

  - question: Where can I find GDP impacts? 
    answer: |
        GDP impacts are captured under ‘transition risk’ and can be further broken down into: 

        a) combined – combined transition and physical risk impacts (including business confidence shocks for the Disorderly scenario)

        b) combined (no bus) – combined transition and physical risk impacts, not including business confidence shocks, available for 
        the Disorderly scenario only

        c) transition – transition risk impacts only
        
        d) physical – physical (chronic) risk impacts only  

        GDP impacts is not available for the Low Demand scenario, and GDP transition risk impacts are not available for the Current 
        Policies scenario as there is only physical risk impacts.

  - question: Where can I find other macroeconomic outputs?
    answer: |
        Other macroeconomic indicators such as inflation are similarly available under the ‘transition risk’ header and are broken down into:   

        a) combined – combined transition and physical risk impacts (including business confidence shocks for the Disorderly scenario)

        b) combined (no bus) – combined transition and physical risk impacts, not including business confidence shocks, available for 
        the Disorderly scenario only

        c) transition – transition risk impacts only

        d) physical – physical (chronic) risk impacts only
