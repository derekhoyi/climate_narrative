    **Sovereign** (or government) bonds are debt securities issued by governments to 
    support government spending. Governments agree to repay the face value of the 
    bond at a specified maturity date and may also pay interest, in the form of 
    coupon payments, at regular intervals throughout the term. Bonds are used to 
    finance and raise capital for the state’s general expenditures and operations, 
    or are earmarked for certain projects such as infrastructure and housing, or nature 
    restoration and climate adaptation.
    
    The government bond sector is a broad category that includes “sovereign” debt, 
    which is issued and generally backed by a central government. UK Gilts, US Treasuries, 
    German Bunds, Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), Brazilian Government Bonds and Government 
    of Canada Bonds (GoCs) are all examples of sovereign government bonds. The US, Japan and 
    Europe have historically been the biggest issuers in the government bond market. 
    Several governments also issue sovereign bonds that are linked to inflation, known as 
    inflation-linked bonds or, in the US, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). 
  
    On an inflation-linked bond, the interest and/or principal is adjusted on a regular basis 
    to reflect changes in the rate of inflation, thus providing a “real,” or inflation-adjusted, 
    return. But, unlike other bonds, inflation-linked bonds could experience greater losses when 
    real interest rates are moving faster than nominal interest rates.
  
    In addition to sovereign bonds, the government bond sector includes
    subcomponents, such as:
  
    - Agency and "quasi-government" bonds: Central governments pursue various
      goals - supporting affordable housing or the development of small
      businesses, for example - through agencies, a number of which issue bonds to
      support their operations. Some agency bonds are guaranteed by the central
      government while others are not. Supranational organisations, like the World
      Bank and the European Investment Bank, also borrow in the bond market to
      finance public projects and/or development. Supranational organisations, like 
      the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, also borrow in the bond market to
      finance public projects and/or development.
  
    - Local government bonds: Local governments - whether provinces, states or
      cities - borrow to finance a variety of projects, from bridges to schools,
      as well as general operations. The market for local government bonds is well
      established in the US, where these bonds are known as municipal bonds. Other
      developed markets also issue provincial/local government bonds.

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, policy reaction, societal change and 
        national energy strategies could lead to significant, albeit delayed increases 
        in the implicit carbon prices. This could have an impact on sovereign bonds in 
        countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources as 
        well as a risk of short-term investment shocks.

        In Orderly scenarios, immediate policy reaction, societal change and national 
        energy strategies could lead to significant increases decarbonisation efforts, 
        represented by implicit carbon prices. This could have an impact on sovereign 
        bonds in countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources.

        In the high physical risk scenarios, physical risks would undermine GDP growth 
        due to increased loss of life, land degradation, risks to crop yields, depletion of 
        natural resources, reduced productivity of the workforce, increasing damages to 
        infrastructure, etc. This would have a negative impact on sovereign bonds.

        In the high physical and transition risk scenarios, physical risks would undermine 
        GDP growth due to increased loss of life, land degradation, risks to crop yields, 
        depletion of natural resources, reduced productivity of the workforce, increased damages 
        to infrastructure, etc. This would have a negative impact on sovereign bonds. 
        Unorganised and delayed climate action leads to increased transition risks, as a 
        lack of effective price signalling and coordination causes supply chain bottlenecks 
        and poor asset valuations and associated decision-making.
