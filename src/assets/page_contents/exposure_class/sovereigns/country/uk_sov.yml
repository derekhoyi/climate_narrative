        In the Delayed Transition scenario, late policy reaction, societal change 
        and national energy strategies could lead to significant, albeit delayed 
        increases in the implicit carbon prices. This could have an impact on 
        sovereign bonds in countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil 
        fuel energy sources as well as a risk of short-term investment shocks.
      always: |
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, late policy action means that a 
        ‘Business-as-Usual’ approach to decarbonisation occurs between now and 
        2030, followed by a sharp increase in policy aggression. The delayed policy 
        ambition reduces the initial disincentivisation against fossil fuels, only 
        to more aggressively penalise and thus risk stranding fossil fuel assets 
        beyond 2030. In this scenario, disorderly policy action results in increased 
        transition risks.
        
        This scenario could have a very strong impact on fiscal revenues in countries 
        with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources. Industries that 
        are negatively impacted by transition risk, such as mining, oil and gas could have 
        reduced revenues from lower fossil fuel demand and increased costs from significantly 
        higher carbon taxes.
        
        On the other hand, government spending (through subsidies and investment) could encourage 
        consumer spending and investment in the use of renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage, 
        etc, leading to increases in fiscal revenues. The Delayed transition risk scenario could also 
        lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This would have a negative impact on UK sovereign bonds.

        **Carbon tax effect**
  
        Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure to carbon intensive 
        sectors and technologies. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors such as oil and gas are 
        consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition risk.
        
        The impact of Delayed transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues is largely dependent on 
        the efficiency of government spending in trying to mitigate these risks. While the use of 
        taxes to incentivize more environmentally friendly production, transportation and consumption 
        patterns can help economies transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly managed transition policy 
        could lead to shocks in economic activity. Depending on the respective country’s size of fossil 
        fuel or renewable energy sectors, green policies, such as carbon taxes would impact, positively 
        or negatively, firms’ profitability, which would, in turn, impact fiscal revenues (for more detail see
        [How could climate change impact sovereign risk](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/research/How%20could%20climate%20change%20impact%20sovereign%20risk%20FINAL.pdf)).
  
        In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy means that a ‘Business-as-Usual’ 
        approach to decarbonisation occurs between now and 2030, followed by a sharp increase 
        in policy aggression, equivalent to an implicit/proxy carbon price increase to ~1,255 USD 
        per tonne CO2 by 2035 and ~6,624 USD per tonne CO2 by 2050 based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario 
        Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs). The delayed policy ambition reduces the initial 
        disincentivisation against fossil fuels, only to more aggressively penalise and thus 
        risk stranding fossil fuel assets beyond 2030. In this scenario, disorderly policy 
        action results in increased transition risks.

        The UK electricity sector has been rapidly decarbonising in recent years, as policy has 
        supported renewables deployment and driven coal out of the electricity mix. Coal provided 
        only 2% of electricity generation in 2023 based on data from IEA, down from ~ 37% a decade ago. 
        The share of biomass in the electricity generation mix has also been increasing, biofuels & waste 
        to energy provided 13% of generation in 2023. 
        
        In 2023 the total share of renewable energy in total electricity generation rose to 36%, up 
        from 31% in 2022, above the global average and there are ambitious plans for further decarbonisation 
        of the electricity supply. The key obstacle to achieving this in a cost-effective way is the 
        development of short- and long-term storage technology that can complement intermittent renewables 
        and avoid the financial disincentives for expansion that arise through the risk of curtailment 
        on windy, sunny days.
        
        The chart below based on IEA data shows that combustion of methane generates the largest share 
        of UK electricity and indeed, due to the ease of adjusting supply from gas to meet marginal demand, 
        its place in the merit order dictates that the wholesale gas price is the dominant factor controlling 
        electricity prices.

        In 2019, the UK committed to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Since then, 
        it has increased the ambition of its 2035 NDC to align with this long-term target, aiming 
        to reduce emissions to 81% below 1990 levels by 2035 (excluding international aviation and 
        shipping emissions). To support this the UK has committed to a fully decarbonised power 
        sector by 2035 as well as no petrol or diesel cars will be sold after 2030. All new cars 
        and vans will need to be 100% zero emissions by 2035. 
        
        However, there are some key weaknesses in the UK’s climate policy approach including the lack 
        of detailed implementation plans as well as a lack of clear policy around increasing energy 
        efficiency in homes.
  
        **GDP growth effect**
  
        A change in a country’s GDP could have an impact on the level of fiscal revenue it receives. 
        Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal 
        revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, Delayed transition could result in significant 
        GDP losses. World GDP impacts from transition risks are negative as the speed of the transition 
        combines with investment uncertainty and affects consumption and investment.
        
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact 
        (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) of a Delayed Transition scenario 
        on the UK GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects, would be significant, at around 
        -2.5% by 2030 and around -5% by 2050.

        **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**
  
        Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. 
        While no sovereign has yet been downgraded solely because of the climate-related 
        risks it faces, there are several examples (e.g. Pakistan in 2022) where the costs 
        associated with extreme weather events have contributed to downgrades. Indeed rating 
        agencies anticipate that climate trends could have implications for ratings in coming 
        decades. According to the 2021 
        [Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness] (https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rising_Climate_Falling_Ratings_Working_Paper.pdf)  
        working paper the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, in the RCP 2.6 scenario (aligned to Delayed 
        Transition and Below 2°C scenarios), most developed countries would be marginally downgraded (1 notch or less). 
        Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. This does not necessarily reflect increased climate-related 
        risks for these top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity of the top ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA rating 
        than a C rating. According to the study, in a transition risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, the UK would have a downgrade of 
        around one notch by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the UK government by approximately US$2-3bn.

        In Orderly scenarios, immediate policy reaction, societal change and national energy

        by transition risk, such as mining, oil and gas could have reduced revenues from lower 
        fossil fuel demand and increased costs from higher carbon taxes.
        
        On the other hand, government spending (through subsidies and investment) could encourage 
        consumer spending and investment in the use of renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage, 
        etc, leading to increases in fiscal revenues. These scenarios could also lead to a limited relative 
        reduction in GDP growth. This would have a limited, neutral impact on British sovereign bonds.

        carbon intensive sectors and technologies. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors 
        such as oil and gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition risk.

        of government spending in trying to mitigate these risks. While the use of taxes to 
        incentivise more environmentally friendly production, transportation and consumption 
        patterns can help economies transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly managed transition 
        policy could lead to shocks in economic activity. Depending on the respective country’s size 
        of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, green policies, such as carbon taxes would impact, 
        positively or negatively, firms’ profitability, which would, in turn, impact fiscal revenues. 
        Conversely, countries with low energy intensity, such as the UK are less vulnerable to transition 
        risk. This is due to more efficient energy use and a greater share of renewable energy in their 
        energy mix, which makes them less dependent on fossil fuels and less exposed to the risks 
        associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy.
        
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the implicit/proxy carbon 
        pricing in USD$ per tonnes absolute difference is highest in the Net Zero 2050 scenario compared 
        to Below 2&deg;C (at 2030, ~1,563 USD per tonne CO2 absolute difference for Net Zero 2050, compared 
        to ~128 USD for Below 2&deg;C; and for 2050, ~9,833 USD for Net Zero 2050, compared to ~1,145 USD for 
        Below 2&deg;C). The implicit carbon pricing is a proxy for the difference in policy ambition required 
        to limit warming to a maximum of 1.5&deg;C (versus 2&deg;C in the Below 2&deg;C scenario).

        In a high physical risk scenario, physical risks would undermine GDP growth due to 
        loss of land, changing crop yields, depleted natural resources, lower productivity 
        of the workforce, damages to infrastructure, etc. Chronic and acute risks could result 
        in lower tax revenues or higher insurance premiums. This could result in a negative impact 
        on GDP globally by 2100 and hit governments’ finances. Extreme weather events such as 
        wildfires, floods, and heat waves could become more prevalent, impacting households, 
        businesses, cities and states. There are also likely indirect risks, such as those 
        caused by international migration (e.g. increased inequalities, labour right issues, 
        social conflicts), or via biodiversity loss, or to industries’ supply chains and 
        international trade.
        
        The high physical risk scenario could lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This would have a 
        negative impact on UK sovereign bonds.
        
        As global temperatures rise in a high physical risk scenario, the effects of climate change, 
        including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in drylands and water scarcity, will likely lead 
        to changes in patterns of human migration. Climate migration could lead to increasing political 
        instability. With people in less developed countries more likely to leave affected areas, this 
        may cause conflicts in receiving areas. Indeed, even within a country, climate change could lead 
        to higher inequality due to slow economic growth in particular areas. As a result, political 
        instability could rise due to climate-related risk issues, both within and between countries.

        **GDP growth effect**
  
        In a high physical risk scenario, global mean temperatures compared to pre-industrial levels 
        could increase across the world by 1.5&deg;C by 2030, by 1.9&deg;C to 2&deg;C by 2050 and ultimately 
        2.3&deg;C to 3&deg;C by 2100 (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experience 
        higher warming). These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting 
        health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can also further 
        change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, 
        cyclones, and flooding.
        
        This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues are dependent 
        on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal expenditures. Assuming 
        taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. 
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a 
        high physical risk scenarios (i.e. Hot house world) on the UK GDP, from chronic physical effects, 
        would be significant, ranging from -5% to -7% (relative to a baseline with no physical risks) by 2050.

Physical damages have been plotted but this causes an underestimate of the true damages to the GDP for the “Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)” scenario and for the existing transition risks facing the economy in a “Current Policies” scenario.
        
        Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including climate resilience 
        investments (e.g. to cope with flooding risks that would propel the growth of economic 
        sectors providing the underlying solutions in terms of products and services).

        from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, in a RCP 8.5 (i.e. high physical risk scenario), 
        most developed countries would be significantly downgraded, with an average downgrade exceeding 
        two notches by 2100. Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. This does not necessarily 
        reflect increased climate-related risks for these top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity of 
        the top ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating. According to the study, in a 
        high physical risk (RCP 8.5) scenario, the UK would have a downgrade exceeding three notches by 
        2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the UK government by approximately US$7.6-11.3bn.

        In the high physical and transition risk scenarios, physical risks would undermine GDP 
        growth due to increased loss of life, land degradation, risks to crop yields, depletion of 
        natural resources, reduced productivity of the workforce, increased damages to infrastructure, etc. 
        This would have a negative impact on sovereign bonds. Unorganised and delayed climate action leads 
        to increased transition risks, as a lack of effective price signalling and coordination causes 
        supply chain bottlenecks and poor asset valuations and associated decision-making.

        In a high physical and transition risk scenario (i.e. too-little-too-late), physical risks such as 
        loss of land, changing crop yields, depleted natural resources, lower productivity of the workforce, 
        damages to infrastructure could undermine GDP growth. Extreme weather events such as wildfires, floods, 
        and heat waves could become more prevalent, impacting households, businesses, cities and states. There 
        are also likely indirect risks, such as those caused by international migration (e.g. increased inequalities, 
        labour right issues, social conflicts), or via biodiversity loss, or to industries’ supply chains and 
        international trade. These factors could lead to a significant reduction in GDP growth, negatively 
        affecting UK sovereign bonds and increasing political instability due to climate-related issues. 
        
        As global temperatures rise in a high physical risk scenario, the effects of climate change, including coastal 
        flooding, reduced rainfall in drylands and water scarcity, will likely lead to changes in patterns of human 
        migration. Climate migration could lead to increasing political instability. With people in less developed 
        countries more likely to leave affected areas, this may cause conflicts in receiving areas. Indeed, even 
        within a country, climate change could lead to higher inequality due to slow economic growth in particular 
        areas. As a result, political instability could rise due to climate-related risk issues, both within and 
        between countries.
        
        Divergent and delayed climate policies could exacerbate these impacts by creating inconsistent regulatory 
        environments and economic disruptions. These inconsistencies can lead to higher operational costs for 
        businesses, impacting employment and economic stability. Additionally, the lack of cohesive policy 
        frameworks may hinder the effectiveness of climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, further 
        exacerbating the risks associated with climate change.

        There would be high physical and transition risks from a too-little-too-late scenario as 
        a result of the delayed (“too late”) implementation and ultimately diverging in their 
        mitigation stringency, thus rendering the overall efforts insufficient to reach net zero 
        (“too little”). Countries in Europe, including the UK, with net zero targets achieve 
        these only partially, while other countries follow current policies leading to increased 
        inequality which would exacerbate regional tensions as well as the physical risk impacts.
  
        **Carbon tax effect**
  
        In the High physical and transition risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario, late and 
        uncoordinated policy reaction means that a ‘Business as Usual’ approach to decarbonisation 
        occurs between now and 2030, followed by a somewhat subdued increase in policy aggression, 
        equivalent to a carbon price increase to ~183 USD per tonne CO₂ by 2035 and ~1,079 USD by 
        2050 based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs). The delayed policy 
        ambition reduces the initial disincentivisation against fossil fuels, only to penalise and thus 
        risk stranding fossil fuel assets beyond 2030. In this scenario, disorderly policy action results 
        in increased transition risks.

        **GDP growth effect**
  
        In the high physical and transition risk scenario (i.e. too-little-too-late), global 
        mean temperatures compared to pre-industrial levels could increase across the world by 
        1.5&deg;C by 2030, by 1.9&deg;C by 2050 and ultimately 2.4&deg;C by 2100 (with land warming faster 
        than oceans and high latitudes experience higher warming). These changes will lead to 
        chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, 
        ecosystems, and sea-level rise, which will consequently impact the rate of growth in GDP. 
        It can also change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, 
        wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.
        
        Research from Burke et al (2015) indicates there is a non-linear effect of increasing temperature 
        on economic output, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13°C and 
        declining strongly at higher temperatures. In a high physical risk scenario, unmitigated warming 
        is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes by roughly 23% by 
        2100, relative to scenarios without climate change.
        
        This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues are dependent 
        on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal expenditures. Assuming 
        taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. 
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a 
        Fragmented World (too-little-too-late) scenario on the UK GDP, from chronic physical and transition 
        effects, would be significant, around -6% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050.

        Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including climate resilience investments 
        (e.g. to cope with flooding risks that would propel the growth of economic sectors providing 
        the underlying solutions in terms of products and services).
  
        **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**
  
        Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. While no 
        sovereign has yet been downgraded solely because of the climate-related risks it faces, 
        there are several examples (e.g. Pakistan in 2022) where the costs associated with 
        extreme weather events have contributed to downgrades. 
        Indeed, rating agencies anticipate that climate trends could have implications 
        for ratings in coming decades. According to the 2021 
        [Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rising_Climate_Falling_Ratings_Working_Paper.pdf)
        from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, in a RCP 8.5 (i.e. high physical risk 
        scenario), most developed countries would be significantly downgraded, with an average 
        downgrade exceeding two notches by 2100. Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. 
        This does not necessarily reflect increased climate-related risks for these top-rated countries, 
        but greater sensitivity of the top ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating. 
        According to the study, in a high physical risk (RCP 8.5) scenario, the UK would have a downgrade 
        exceeding three notches by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the UK government by 
        approximately US$7.6-11.3bn.
        
        **Transition impacts**
  
        Transition Impacts corresponding to a High Transition and Physical Risk (Too-Little-Too-Late) scenario include:
        
          - **Inconsistent regulatory environments**: Divergent climate policies could lead to regulatory 
          uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to plan and invest. For example, the UK's mixed 
          messages on carbon pricing and the slow implementation of climate policies have created uncertainty 
          for businesses, particularly in the energy and manufacturing sectors.
          
          - **Economic disruptions**: Delayed and fragmented policies may cause economic instability, 
          affecting various sectors differently and leading to uneven growth.
          
          - **Higher operational costs**: Businesses may face increased costs due to the need to comply 
          with varying regulations and invest in climate adaptation measures.
          
          - **Impact on employment**: Economic disruptions and higher operational costs could lead 
          to job losses and reduced employment opportunities.
          
          - **Ineffective climate adaptation and mitigation**: Lack of cohesive policy frameworks 
          may hinder efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change, exacerbating physical risks. 
          
          - **Increased inequality and regional tensions**: Fragmented policies could lead to disparities in 
          climate action, exacerbating social and economic inequalities and regional tensions. The North-South 
          divide in the UK highlights significant regional disparities, with the north facing higher unemployment 
          and lower incomes, which could be worsened by uneven climate action.
