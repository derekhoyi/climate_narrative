    **Sovereign** (or government) bonds are debt securities issued by governments to 
    support government spending. Governments agree to repay the face value of the 
    bond at a specified maturity date and may also pay interest, in the form of 
    coupon payments, at regular intervals throughout the term. Bonds are used to 
    finance and raise capital for the state’s general expenditures and operations, 
    or are earmarked for certain projects such as infrastructure and housing, or nature 
    restoration and climate adaptation.
    
    The government bond sector is a broad category that includes “sovereign” debt, 
    which is issued and generally backed by a central government. UK Gilts, US Treasuries, 
    German Bunds, Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), Brazilian Government Bonds and Government 
    of Canada Bonds (GoCs) are all examples of sovereign government bonds. The US, Japan and 
    Europe have historically been the biggest issuers in the government bond market. 
    Several governments also issue sovereign bonds that are linked to inflation, known as 
    inflation-linked bonds or, in the US, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). 
  
    On an inflation-linked bond, the interest and/or principal is adjusted on a regular basis 
    to reflect changes in the rate of inflation, thus providing a “real,” or inflation-adjusted, 
    return. But, unlike other bonds, inflation-linked bonds could experience greater losses when 
    real interest rates are moving faster than nominal interest rates.
  
    In addition to sovereign bonds, the government bond sector includes
    subcomponents, such as:
  
    - Agency and "quasi-government" bonds: Central governments pursue various
      goals - supporting affordable housing or the development of small
      businesses, for example - through agencies, a number of which issue bonds to
      support their operations. Some agency bonds are guaranteed by the central
      government while others are not. Supranational organisations, like the World
      Bank and the European Investment Bank, also borrow in the bond market to
      finance public projects and/or development. Supranational organisations, like 
      the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, also borrow in the bond market to
      finance public projects and/or development.
  
    - Local government bonds: Local governments - whether provinces, states or
      cities - borrow to finance a variety of projects, from bridges to schools,
      as well as general operations. The market for local government bonds is well
      established in the US, where these bonds are known as municipal bonds. Other
      developed markets also issue provincial/local government bonds.
  
    In this report we refer to a ‘20-notch’ sovereign bond rating scale translated 
    from S&P’s alphabetical standardized rating scale (see Appendices), which is used 
    to outline changes to sovereign bond ratings, as is common in surrounding literature. 
    Impacts of climate change on sovereign bond ratings are discussed in reference to the 
    2021 working paper titled “Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate 
    Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness” from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy. 
    This study represents one approach towards quantifying the effects of climate change 
    on credit ratings and is illustrative based on a hypothetical model. Whilst conclusions 
    are referred to on the impact on bond ratings, it is worth highlighting that this paper 
    focuses on the physical climate risk impacts on credit ratings, and not on the demands 
    of transition, nor on the knock-on effects that climate change may cause or exacerbate 
    such as resource conflicts, political volatility, or supply chain disruptions.

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, late policy reaction, societal change 
        and national energy strategies could lead to significant, albeit delayed 
        increases in the implicit carbon prices. This could have an impact on 
        sovereign bonds in countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil 
        fuel energy sources as well as a risk of short-term investment shocks.
      always: |
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, late policy action means that a ‘Business-as-Usual’ 
        approach to decarbonisation occurs between now and 2030, followed by a sharp increase 
        in policy aggression. The delayed policy ambition reduces the initial disincentivisation 
        against fossil fuels, only to more aggressively penalise and thus risk stranding fossil 
        fuel assets beyond 2030. In this scenario, disorderly policy action results in increased 
        transition risks.
        
        This scenario could have a very strong impact on fiscal revenues in countries with a 
        strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources. Industries that are negatively 
        impacted by transition risk, such as mining, oil and gas could have reduced revenues from 
        lower fossil fuel demand and increased costs from significantly higher carbon taxes.
        
        On the other hand, government spending (through subsidies and investment) could encourage consumer 
        spending and investment in the use of renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage, etc, leading 
        to increases in fiscal revenues.
        
        Scenario analysis of the effects of climate-related risks on the US federal budget up to the end 
        of this century have assessed lost revenue for the federal government, by transposing projections 
        from global integrated assessment models to the US. Climate-related expenditures are expected to 
        range from $9 to $28 billion annually (in today’s dollars), and revenue losses vary between 
        $56 billion and $111 billion. [(The risks from climate change to sovereign debt in Europe | Bruegel).](https://euagenda.eu/upload/publications/pc-2021-16-070721-1.pdf)
        
        The Delayed transition scenario could also lead to a reduction in GDP growth. Based on the 
        IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the impact of the Delayed 
        transition scenario on the US GDP would be about twice as much as the one on the UK by 2050.

        **Carbon tax effect**
  
        Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure to carbon 
        intensive sectors and technologies. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors such as 
        oil and gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition risk.
        
        The impact of Delayed transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues is largely dependent 
        on the efficiency of government spending in trying to mitigate these risks. While the use 
        of taxes to incentivize more environmentally friendly production, transportation and 
        consumption patterns can help economies transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly 
        managed transition policy could lead to shocks in economic activity. Depending on the 
        respective country’s size of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, green policies, 
        such as carbon taxes would impact, positively or negatively, firms’ profitability, which 
        would, in turn, impact fiscal revenues (for more detail see
        [How could climate change impact sovereign risk](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/research/How%20could%20climate%20change%20impact%20sovereign%20risk%20FINAL.pdf)).
  
        In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy means that a ‘Business-as-Usual’ approach 
        to decarbonisation occurs between now and 2030, followed by a sharp increase in policy 
        aggression, equivalent to an implicit/proxy carbon price increase to ~1,430 USD per tonne 
        CO₂ by 2035 and ~7,496 USD per tonne CO2 by 2050 based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer 
        NiGEM model (REMIND inputs). The delayed policy ambition reduces the initial disincentivisation 
        against fossil fuels, only to more aggressively penalise and thus risk stranding fossil fuel 
        assets beyond 2030. In this scenario, disorderly policy action results in increased transition risks.

        Total GHG emissions in the US in 2021 were 15% below 2005 levels. By 2023 this decline had improved 
        to 18%. This trend was primarily driven due to the power sector, driven by a shift from coal to 
        lower or non-emitting sources of generation, such as natural gas and renewables. Generation 
        from wind and solar grew in 2021, by 12% and 29% respectively compared to 2020. From 2021 to 
        2023 there has been further growth at respective annual compounded rates of 6% and 20%. 
        
        In 2018, the US became the world’s largest producer of crude oil. The production of oil in 2021 
        remained relatively stable, decreasing only by 1% from 2020 levels. In response to rising prices 
        and energy security concerns due to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, President Biden is now 
        encouraging US oil and gas producers to drill and increase production. This is one Biden policy 
        that Trump has no intention of reversing.
        
        The US is significantly more dependent on fossil fuel sectors and consequently has a lower share 
        of renewable energy compared to the UK or its European counterparts.
        
        The chart below based on IEA data shows that the phase down of coal is quite gradual and while wind and 
        solar are taking up some of the slack, it is the expansion of gas that characterises the US “transition”.

        **GDP growth effect**
  
        A change in a country’s GDP could have an impact on the level of fiscal revenue 
        it receives. Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead 
        to a reduction in fiscal revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, Delayed 
        transition could result in significant GDP losses. World GDP impacts from transition 
        risks are negative as the speed of the transition combines with investment uncertainty 
        and affects consumption and investment.
        
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact 
        (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) of a Delayed Transition scenario 
        on the US GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects, would be significant, at around 
        -4% by 2030 and around -8% by 2050.

        **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**
  
        Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. 
        While no sovereign has yet been downgraded solely because of the climate-related 
        risks it faces, there are several examples (e.g. Pakistan in 2022) where the costs 
        associated with extreme weather events have contributed to downgrades. Indeed rating 
        agencies anticipate that climate trends could have implications for ratings in coming 
        decades. According to the 2021 
        [Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness] (https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rising_Climate_Falling_Ratings_Working_Paper.pdf)   
        working paper the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, in the RCP 2.6 scenario (aligned to Delayed 
        Transition and Below 2&deg;C scenarios), most developed countries would be marginally downgraded 
        (1 notch or less). Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. This does not necessarily 
        reflect increased climate-related risks for these top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity of 
        the top ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating. According to the study, in a 
        transition risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, the US would have a downgrade below one notch by 2100, increasing 
        the cost of borrowing for the US government by approximately US$7.35-11.03bn.

        In Orderly scenarios, immediate policy reaction, societal change and national energy 
        strategies could lead to significant and immediate increases in effective carbon prices. 
        This could have a strong impact on fiscal revenues in countries with a strong level of 
        dependence on fossil fuel energy sources. Industries/sectors that are negatively impacted 
        by transition risk, such as mining, oil and gas could have reduced revenues from lower 
        fossil fuel demand and increased costs from higher carbon taxes.

        limited, neutral impact on US sovereign bonds.

        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the implicit/proxy 
        carbon pricing in USD$ per tonnes absolute difference is highest in the Net Zero 2050 scenario 
        compared to Below 2&deg;C (at 2030, ~1,598 USD per tonne CO2 absolute difference for Net Zero 2050, 
        compared to ~163 USD for Below 2&deg;C; and for 2050, ~7,718 USD for Net Zero 2050, compared to ~1,064 USD 
        for Below 2&deg;C). The implicit carbon pricing is a proxy for the difference in policy ambition required 
        to limit warming to a maximum of 1.5&deg;C (versus 2&deg;C in the Below 2&deg;C scenario).

        In August 2022, US President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), setting 
        the country’s emissions on a trajectory towards meeting its climate commitment to cut GHG emissions 
        in half by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. The CAT estimates that implementation of IRA will decrease 
        US emissions will to 26-42% below 2005 levels. This means more action is required to meet their climate 
        commitment though this is unlikely to be a priority for the Trump administration.

        In a high physical risk scenario, physical risks would undermine GDP growth due 
        to loss of land, changing crop yields, depleted natural resources, lower productivity 
        of the workforce, damages to infrastructure, etc. Chronic and acute risks could result in 
        lower tax revenues or higher insurance premiums. This could result in a negative impact on 
        GDP globally by 2100 and hit governments’ finances. Extreme weather events such as wildfires, 
        floods, and heat waves could become more prevalent, impacting households, businesses, cities 
        and states. There are also likely indirect risks, such as those caused by international migration 
        (e.g. increased inequalities, labour right issues, social conflicts), or via biodiversity loss, or 
        to industries’ supply chains and international trade.
        
        The high physical risk scenario could lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This would have a 
        negative impact on US sovereign bonds.
        
        As global temperatures rise in a high physical risk scenario, the effects of climate change, 
        including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in drylands and water scarcity, will likely lead 
        to changes in patterns of human migration. Climate migration could lead to increasing political 
        instability. With people in less developed countries more likely to leave affected areas, this 
        may cause conflicts in receiving areas. Indeed, even within a country, climate change could lead 
        to higher inequality due to slow economic growth in particular areas. As a result, political 
        instability could rise due to climate-related risk issues, both within and between countries.
      high_materiality: |
        **GDP growth effect**
  
        In a high physical risk scenario, global mean temperatures compared to pre-industrial 
        levels could increase across the world by 1.5&deg;C by 2030, by 1.9&deg;C to 2&deg;C by 2050 and 
        ultimately 2.3&deg;C to 3&deg;C by 2100 (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes 
        experience higher warming). These changes could lead to chronic changes in living conditions 
        affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise. It can 
        also further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, 
        wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.
        
        This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues are dependent 
        on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal expenditures. Assuming 
        taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. 
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of an 
        high physical risk scenarios (i.e. Hot House World) on the US GDP, from chronic physical effects, 
        would be significant, ranging from -9% to -11% (relative to a baseline with no physical risks) by 2050.

NiGEM NGFS v1.24.2 [REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8.].](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads) For NGFS “Current Policies”, there are no estimated GDP loses from transition risk, so a combined is not available. Physical damages have been plotted but this causes an underestimate of the true damages to the GDP for the “Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)” scenario and for the existing transition risks facing the economy in a “Current Policies” scenario.
        
        Small and least diversified economies with lower resilience and adaptive capacity could 
        count among the most vulnerable countries. For example, in the US, certain states (e.g. Florida) 
        and cities (e.g. Miami) would be especially exposed to material risks (e.g. via reduced tax revenues 
        and greater costs, for example on healthcare and infrastructure or direct support to businesses and 
        individuals most adversely impacted). Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including 
        climate resilience investments (e.g. to cope with flooding risks that would propel the growth of 
        economic sectors providing the underlying solutions in terms of products and services). In the US, 
        the economic costs of natural hazards such as drought, flooding, storms, or cyclones would be 
        exacerbated. Indeed, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events (defined as wreaking 
        more than $3 billion (CPI adjusted) of damage) has already increased dramatically. While the 
        period from 2009 – 2014 saw 2 floods, 4 tropical cyclones and no wildfires, the comparable period 
        a decade later from 2019 – 2024 experienced 4 floods, 13 tropical cyclones and 5 wildfires. This 
        data comes from the National Centres for Environmental Information.
  
        **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**
  
        Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. While 
        no sovereign has yet been downgraded solely because of the climate-related risks it 
        faces, there are several examples (e.g. Pakistan in 2022) where the costs associated 
        with extreme weather events have contributed to downgrades. Indeed rating agencies 
        anticipate that climate trends could have implications for ratings in coming decades. 
        According to the 2021 
        [Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rising_Climate_Falling_Ratings_Working_Paper.pdf) 
        from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, in a RCP 8.5 (i.e. high physical risk scenario), most 
        developed countries would be significantly downgraded, with an average downgrade exceeding two 
        notches by 2100. Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. This does not necessarily 
        reflect increased climate-related risks for these top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity 
        of the top ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating. According to the study, 
        in a high physical risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, the US would have a downgrade below one notch by 2100, 
        increasing the cost of borrowing for the US government by approximately US$7.35-11.03bn.

        In the high physical and transition risk scenarios, physical risks would undermine GDP 
        growth due to increased loss of life, land degradation, risks to crop yields, depletion of 
        natural resources, reduced productivity of the workforce, increased damages to infrastructure, etc. 
        This would have a negative impact on sovereign bonds. Unorganised and delayed climate action leads 
        to increased transition risks, as a lack of effective price signalling and coordination causes 
        supply chain bottlenecks and poor asset valuations and associated decision-making.
      always: |
        In a high physical and transition risk scenario (i.e. too-little-too-late), physical risks would 
        undermine GDP growth due to loss of land, changing crop yields, depleted natural resources, lower 
        productivity of the workforce, damages to infrastructure, etc. Chronic and acute risks could result 
        in lower tax revenues or higher insurance premiums. This would result in a material negative impact 
        on GDP globally by 2100 and hit governments’ finances. Extreme weather events such as wildfires, floods, 
        and heat waves could become more prevalent, impacting households, businesses, cities and states. There 
        are also likely indirect risks, such as those caused by international migration (e.g. increased 
        inequalities, labour right issues, social conflicts), or via biodiversity loss, or to industries’ 
        supply chains and international trade.
        
        The high physical risk scenario could lead to a significant reduction in GDP growth. This would 
        have a negative impact on US sovereign bonds. 
        
        As global temperatures rise in a high physical risk scenario, the effects of climate change, 
        including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in drylands and water scarcity, will likely lead 
        to changes in patterns of human migration. Climate migration could lead to increasing political 
        instability. With people in less developed countries more likely to leave affected areas, this may cause 
        conflicts in receiving areas. Indeed, even within a country, climate change could lead to higher 
        inequality due to slow economic growth in particular areas. As a result, political instability 
        could rise due to climate-related risk issues, both within and between countries.
        
        Divergent and delayed climate policies could exacerbate these impacts by creating inconsistent 
        regulatory environments and economic disruptions. These inconsistencies can lead to higher 
        operational costs for businesses, impacting employment and economic stability. Additionally, 
        the lack of cohesive policy frameworks may hinder the effectiveness of climate adaptation and 
        mitigation efforts, further exacerbating the risks associated with climate change.
      high_materiality: |
        There would be high transition and physical risks from a too-little-too-late scenario as a 
        result of the delayed (“too late”) implementation of regulation which ultimately may lack 
        mitigation stringency, thus rendering the overall efforts insufficient to reach net zero 
        (“too little”). Were this scenario to play out, the US could experience increased regional 
        inequality as well as cross-border tensions.
  
        **Carbon tax effect**
  
        In the High physical and transition risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario, late and 
        uncoordinated policy reaction means that a ‘Business as Usual’ approach to decarbonisation 
        occurs between now and 2030, followed by a somewhat subdued increase in policy aggression, 
        equivalent to a carbon price increase to ~227 USD per tonne CO₂ by 2035 and ~1,343 USD by 
        2050 based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs). The delayed 
        policy ambition reduces the initial disincentivisation against fossil fuels, only to penalise 
        and thus risk stranding fossil fuel assets beyond 2030. In this scenario, disorderly policy 
        action results in increased transition risks.

        **GDP growth effect**
  
        In the high physical and transition risk scenario (i.e. too-little-too-late), global mean 
        temperatures compared to pre-industrial levels could increase across the world by 1.5&deg;C by 
        2030, by 1.9&deg;C by 2050 and ultimately 2.4&deg;C by 2100 (with land warming faster than oceans and 
        high latitudes experience higher warming). These changes will lead to chronic changes in living 
        conditions affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise, 
        which will consequently impact the rate of growth in GDP. It can also change the frequency and 
        severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.
        
        Research from Burke et al (2015) indicates there is a non-linear effect of increasing temperature on 
        economic output, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13°C and declining 
        strongly at higher temperatures. In a high physical risk scenario, unmitigated warming is expected 
        to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes by roughly 23% by 2100, relative 
        to scenarios without climate change.
        
        This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues are dependent on 
        economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal expenditures. Assuming taxation 
        rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. Based on the 
        IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a Fragmented World 
        (too-little-too-late) scenario on the US GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects, would be 
        significant, around -10% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050.

        Small and least diversified economies with lower resilience and adaptive capacity could count among 
        the most vulnerable countries. For example, in the US, certain states (e.g. Florida) and cities 
        (e.g. Miami) would be especially exposed to material risks (e.g. via reduced tax revenues and greater 
        costs, for example on healthcare and infrastructure or direct support to businesses and individuals 
        most adversely impacted). Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including climate resilience 
        investments (e.g. to cope with flooding risks that would propel the growth of economic sectors providing 
        the underlying solutions in terms of products and services). In the US, the economic costs of natural 
        hazards such as drought, flooding, storms, or cyclones would be exacerbated. Indeed, the frequency and 
        severity of extreme weather events (defined as wreaking more than $3 billion (CPI adjusted) of damage) 
        has already increased dramatically. While the period from 2009 – 2014 saw 2 floods, 4 tropical cyclones 
        and no wildfires, the comparable period a decade later from 2019 – 2024 experienced 4 floods, 13 tropical 
        cyclones and 5 wildfires. This data comes from the National Centres for Environmental Information.

        Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. While no 
        sovereign has yet been downgraded solely because of the climate-related risks it faces, there 
        are several examples (e.g. Pakistan in 2022) where the costs associated with extreme weather 
        events have contributed to downgrades. Indeed rating agencies anticipate that climate trends could 
        have implications for ratings in coming decades. According to the 2021

        increasing the cost of borrowing for the US government by approximately US$63.2-94.8bn.
        
        **Transition impacts**
  
        Transition Impacts corresponding to a High Transition and Physical Risk (Too-Little-Too-Late) scenario include:
        
          - **Inconsistent regulatory environments**: Divergent climate policies could lead to regulatory 
          uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to plan and invest. For example, mixed messages 
          on carbon pricing and the slow implementation of climate policies have created uncertainty for 
          businesses, particularly in the energy and manufacturing sectors.
          
          - **Economic disruptions**: Delayed and fragmented policies may cause economic instability, 
          affecting various sectors differently and leading to uneven growth.
          
          - **Higher operational costs**: Businesses may face increased costs due to the need to comply 
          with varying regulations and invest in climate adaptation measures.
          
          - **Impact on employment**: Economic disruptions and higher operational costs could lead 
          to job losses and reduced employment opportunities.
          
          - **Ineffective climate adaptation and mitigation**: Lack of cohesive policy frameworks 
          may hinder efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change, exacerbating physical risks. 
          
          - **Increased inequality and regional tensions**: Fragmented policies could lead to disparities in 
          climate action, exacerbating social and economic inequalities and regional tensions. Regional 
          disparities across the US (for example the Central / Coastal divide) highlight the possibility 
          of significantly varying responses, with some areas facing higher unemployment, lower incomes, 
          and additional migration which could be worsened by uneven climate action.
