    **Sovereign** (or government) bonds are debt securities issued by governments to 
    support government spending. Governments agree to repay the face value of the 
    bond at a specified maturity date and may also pay interest, in the form of 
    coupon payments, at regular intervals throughout the term. Bonds are used to 
    finance and raise capital for the state’s general expenditures and operations, 
    or are earmarked for certain projects such as infrastructure and housing, or nature 
    restoration and climate adaptation.
    
    The government bond sector is a broad category that includes “sovereign” debt, 
    which is issued and generally backed by a central government. UK Gilts, US Treasuries, 
    German Bunds, Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), Brazilian Government Bonds and Government 
    of Canada Bonds (GoCs) are all examples of sovereign government bonds. The US, Japan and 
    Europe have historically been the biggest issuers in the government bond market. 
    Several governments also issue sovereign bonds that are linked to inflation, known as 
    inflation-linked bonds or, in the US, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). 
  
    On an inflation-linked bond, the interest and/or principal is adjusted on a regular basis 
    to reflect changes in the rate of inflation, thus providing a “real,” or inflation-adjusted, 
    return. But, unlike other bonds, inflation-linked bonds could experience greater losses when 
    real interest rates are moving faster than nominal interest rates.
  
    In addition to sovereign bonds, the government bond sector includes
    subcomponents, such as:
  
    - Agency and "quasi-government" bonds: Central governments pursue various
      goals - supporting affordable housing or the development of small
      businesses, for example - through agencies, a number of which issue bonds to
      support their operations. Some agency bonds are guaranteed by the central
      government while others are not. Supranational organisations, like the World
      Bank and the European Investment Bank, also borrow in the bond market to
      finance public projects and/or development. Supranational organisations, like 
      the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, also borrow in the bond market to
      finance public projects and/or development.
  
    - Local government bonds: Local governments - whether provinces, states or
      cities - borrow to finance a variety of projects, from bridges to schools,
      as well as general operations. The market for local government bonds is well
      established in the US, where these bonds are known as municipal bonds. Other
      developed markets also issue provincial/local government bonds.
  
    In this report we refer to a ‘20-notch’ sovereign bond rating scale translated 
    from S&P’s alphabetical standardized rating scale (see Appendices), which is used 
    to outline changes to sovereign bond ratings, as is common in surrounding literature. 
    Impacts of climate change on sovereign bond ratings are discussed in reference to the 
    2021 working paper titled “Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate 
    Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness” from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy. 
    This study represents one approach towards quantifying the effects of climate change 
    on credit ratings and is illustrative based on a hypothetical model. Whilst conclusions 
    are referred to on the impact on bond ratings, it is worth highlighting that this paper 
    focuses on the physical climate risk impacts on credit ratings, and not on the demands 
    of transition, nor on the knock-on effects that climate change may cause or exacerbate 
    such as resource conflicts, political volatility, or supply chain disruptions.

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, late policy reaction, societal change 
        and national energy strategies could lead to significant, albeit delayed 
        increases in the implicit carbon prices. This could have an impact on 
        sovereign bonds in countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil 
        fuel energy sources as well as a risk of short-term investment shocks.
        
      always: |
        In the Delayed transition risk scenario, late policy action means that a 
        “Business-as-Usual” approach to decarbonisation occurs between now and 2030, 
        followed by a sharp increase in policy aggression. This means that the initial 
        effective carbon price increases at a slower rate compared to Orderly scenarios 
        until 2030, but significantly higher effective carbon prices thereafter as 
        countries make up for lost ground.
        
        This scenario could have a very strong impact on fiscal revenues in countries 
        with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources. Industries that 
        are negatively impacted by transition risk, such as mining, oil and gas could have 
        reduced revenues from lower fossil fuel demand and increased costs from significantly 
        higher carbon taxes.
        
        On the other hand, government spending (through subsidies and investment) could 
        encourage consumer spending and investment in the use of renewables, energy efficiency, 
        energy storage, etc, leading to increases in fiscal revenues. The Delayed transition 
        risk scenario could also lead to a reduction in GDP growth.

        **Carbon tax effect**
  
        Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure to carbon 
        intensive sectors and technologies. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors such as 
        oil and gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition risk.
        
        The impact of Delayed transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues is largely dependent 
        on the efficiency of government spending in trying to mitigate these risks. While the use 
        of taxes to incentivize more environmentally friendly production, transportation and 
        consumption patterns can help economies transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly 
        managed transition policy could lead to shocks in economic activity. Depending on the 
        respective country’s size of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, green policies, 
        such as carbon taxes would impact, positively or negatively, firms’ profitability, 
        which would, in turn, impact fiscal revenues (for more detail see
         [How could climate change impact sovereign risk](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/research/How%20could%20climate%20change%20impact%20sovereign%20risk%20FINAL.pdf)).
  
        In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction means that a ‘Business-as-Usual’ 
        approach to decarbonisation occurs between now and 2030, followed by a sharp increase in 
        policy aggression, equivalent to an implicit/proxy carbon price increase to ~294 USD per 
        tonne CO₂ by 2035 and ~1,302 USD by 2050 based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model 
        (REMIND inputs). The delayed policy ambition reduces the initial disincentivisation against 
        fossil fuels, only begin penalising emissions and thus risk stranding fossil fuel assets 
        beyond 2030. In this scenario, disorderly policy action results in increased transition risks.

        Based on data from IEA (see below graph), in 2023 the renewables share of power in 
        Brazil reached ~81%. Brazil’s primary source of power is hydroelectricity, with 
        over 60% of the electricity grid coming from hydropower in 2023. This means that 
        Brazil’s share of renewables in power generation has been markedly higher than 
        the global average since the 1990s. Hydropower, whilst renewable and low-emissions 
        (excluding possible site-specific emissions relating to the change in land-use), 
        does have an exposure to physical impacts via droughts that reduce the water level 
        and thus the operational ability of the hydropower plants. In 2021 an drought caused 
        an energy crisis, that combined with the volatility in oil and gas prices led to a 
        raising of electricity prices. The share of variable renewables such as wind and 
        solar has increased dramatically in the past decade, with market trends being 
        favourable for them across the volatile policy landscape climate and energy has faced. 
        Wind and Solar make up 14% and 7% respective in 2023 electricity generation. Generation 
        from Solar in particular has grown by ×10,000 in the decade between 2013 and 2023. As 
        of now, the electricity mix is over 80% renewables.
        
        Brazil’s energy infrastructure planning has historically been volatile. In the power grid, 
        fossil fuels went from 9% of electricity generation in 2000, to a peak of 25% in 2014. The Paris 
        agreement had led to a decline before it spoked again in 2021, only to go back down and reach 
        the same level of 9% in 2000 in 2023, matching the share it had in 2000. Expansion of fossil 
        fuel infrastructure has in the past been a major concern for the transition risks it exposes Brazil to. 
        
        Brazil's latest renewable energy plan, unveiled in January 2025, highlights that Brazil 
        is planning to add 50 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2035, which would significantly 
        boost the country's renewable energy portfolio. Brazil's policy direction towards 
        achieving a phase-down of fossil fuels is still evolving. On one hand, Brazil is 
        investing heavily in renewable energy projects, including solar and biomass. On the 
        other hand, the government continues to support fossil fuels, with recent approvals 
        for new fossil (natural) gas infrastructure.
        
        The government is also focusing on integrating renewable energy into the national grid 
        through advanced ancillary services and energy storage solutions to address the 
        intermittency of renewable sources. This approach aims to ensure energy security 
        and stability while promoting sustainable development.

        Similarly, changes in LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry) sector have been volatile, 
        with periods of very high deforestation in the recent past. 
        
        In a Delayed transition scenario, Brazil's efforts to protect and restore the Amazon rainforest 
        are stymied in the near-term, with significant knock-on effects to the region’s climate and 
        global carbon sequestration. When policy direction shifts, a much-reduced carbon sink will 
        be available, with some parts of the forest in terminal decline leading to much of the amazon 
        becoming a net carbon source rather than a sink, due to desiccation and the self-sustaining 
        rains fail due to fragmented and reduced rainforest extent. Any remaining forests would be 
        heavily protected, with significant impacts to businesses such as agriculture, and risks of 
        excluding indigenous populations form traditional use and management of lands that were 
        historically theirs. Restoration of rainforest is possible, but there would be a significant 
        delay to recover the biodiversity and ecosystem services lost in the era of inaction.
        
        **GDP growth effect**
  
        A change in a country’s GDP could have an impact on the level of fiscal revenue it receives. 
        Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal 
        revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, Delayed transition could result in significant GDP 
        losses. World GDP impacts from transition risks are negative as the speed of the transition combines 
        with investment uncertainty and affects consumption and investment.
        
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact (relative 
        to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) of a Delayed Transition scenario on Brazil’s GDP, 
        from chronic physical and transition effects, would be significant, at around -8% by 2030 and around -17% by 2050.

        **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**
  
        Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. 
        No sovereign has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related risks it faces, 
        although rating agencies anticipate that climate trends could have implications for ratings in 
        coming decades. According to the 2021 [Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness] (https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rising_Climate_Falling_Ratings_Working_Paper.pdf)
        working paper the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, in the RCP 2.6 scenario (aligned to 
        Delayed Transition and Below 2&deg;C scenarios), most developed countries would be marginally 
        downgraded (1 notch or less). Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. This 
        does not necessarily reflect increased climate-related risks for these top-rated countries, 
        but greater sensitivity of the top ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating. 
        According to the study, in a transition risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, Brazil is unlikely to have a 
        climate-induced sovereign downgrade.

        In Orderly scenarios, immediate policy reaction, societal change and national energy 
        strategies could lead to significant and immediate increases in effective carbon prices. 
        This could have a strong impact on fiscal revenues in countries with a strong level of 
        dependence on fossil fuel energy sources. Industries/sectors that are negatively impacted 
        by transition risk, such as mining, oil and gas could have reduced revenues from lower fossil 
        fuel demand and increased costs from higher carbon taxes.

        leading to increases in fiscal revenues. These scenarios could also lead to a limited relative 
        reduction in GDP growth. This would have a limited, neutral impact on Brazilian sovereign bonds.

        **Carbon tax effect**
  
        Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure to carbon intensive 
        sectors and technologies. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors such as oil and gas are 
        consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition risk.
        
        The impact from the Orderly scenarios on fiscal revenues is largely dependent on the efficiency 
        of government spending in trying to mitigate these risks. While the use of taxes to incentivize 
        more environmentally friendly production, transportation and consumption patterns can help economies 
        transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly managed transition policy could lead to shocks in economic 
        activity. Depending on the respective country’s size of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, 
        green policies, such as carbon taxes would impact, positively or negatively, firms’ profitability, 
        which would, in turn, impact fiscal revenues. Conversely, countries with low energy intensity, such 
        as Brazil, are less vulnerable to transition risks. This is due to the high share of low-carbon sources 
        of power, especially hydropower, in their energy mix, which makes Brazil less dependent on fossil fuels 
        and the associated risks with transition to a low-carbon economy.
        
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the implicit/proxy carbon 
        pricing in USD$ per tonnes absolute difference is highest in the Net Zero 2050 scenario compared to 
        Below 2&deg;C (at 2030, ~1,102 USD per tonne CO2 absolute difference for Net Zero 2050, compared to ~133 USD 
        for Below 2&deg;C; and for 2050, ~6,721 USD for Net Zero 2050, compared to ~1,150 USD for Below 2&deg;C). The 
        implicit carbon pricing is a proxy for the difference in policy ambition required to limit warming to a 
        maximum of 1.5&deg;C (versus 2&deg;C in the Below 2&deg;C scenario).

        In 2021 a drought caused an energy crisis, that combined with the volatility in oil and 
        gas prices led to a raising of electricity prices. The share of variable renewables such 
        as wind and solar has increased dramatically in the past decade, with market trends being

        Similarly, changes in LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry) sector 
        have been volatile, with periods of very high deforestation in the recent past. 
        However there has been a recent move to significantly reduce the deforestation 
        in the Amazon, with the rate having between 2021 and 2024.
        
        In an Orderly scenario, Brazil's efforts to protect and restore the Amazon rainforest 
        are significantly enhanced through coordinated policies and international cooperation. 
        The government implements stringent anti-deforestation laws, invests in reforestation projects, 
        and promotes sustainable land use practices. These measures help to preserve the Amazon's 
        biodiversity and its role as a critical carbon sink. By prioritizing the conservation of 
        the Amazon, Brazil can mitigate the impacts of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas 
        emissions. The preservation of the rainforest supports the livelihoods of indigenous 
        communities and promotes eco-tourism, contributing to economic growth.
  
        **GDP growth effect**
  
        A change in a country’s GDP could have an impact on the level of fiscal revenue it receives. Assuming taxation 
        rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. 
        
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the GDP losses 
        from chronic physical and transition effects are estimated to be around -8% (relative to 
        a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2030 and from -13% to -16% by 2050 for Brazil.

        in the RCP 2.6 Scenario (aligned to Delayed Transition and Below 2°C scenarios), Brazil is unlikely

        This does not necessarily reflect increased climate-related risks for these top-rated countries, but 
        greater sensitivity of the top ratings. It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating. As Brazil 
        is not expected to downgrade by 2100, no climate-related increase in the cost of borrowing is expected 
        for the Brazilian government.

        In a high physical risk scenario, physical risks would undermine GDP growth due to loss of 
        land, changing crop yields, depleted natural resources, lower productivity of the workforce, 
        damages to infrastructure, etc. Chronic and acute risks could result in lower tax revenues or 
        higher insurance premiums. This could result in a negative impact on GDP globally by 2100 and 
        hit governments’ finances. Extreme weather events such as wildfires, floods, and heat waves 
        could become more prevalent, impacting households, businesses, cities and states. There are 
        also likely indirect risks, such as those caused by international migration (e.g. increased 
        inequalities, labour right issues, social conflicts), or via biodiversity loss, or to 
        industries’ supply chains and international trade.
        
        Wet bulb temperatures, which combine heat and humidity, could reach levels that make outdoor 
        work unsafe in some regions. This would severely impact labour productivity, especially in 
        sectors like agriculture and construction, where outdoor work is prevalent. 
        
        A study at the University of Exeter ([Hot weather hits productivity – even in air-conditioned factories - News](https://news.exeter.ac.uk/research/hot-weather-hits-productivity-even-in-air-conditioned-factories/)) 
        further found that productivity dropped even in air-conditioned factories. For example, 
        productivity dropped by 5.8% when wet-bulb temperatures exceeded 28°C.
        
        The high physical risk scenario could lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This would 
        have a negative impact on Brazilian sovereign bonds. 
        
        As global temperatures rise in a high physical risk scenario, the effects of climate change, 
        including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in drylands and water scarcity, will likely lead 
        to changes in patterns of human migration. Climate migration could lead to increasing political 
        instability. With people in less developed countries more likely to leave affected areas, this 
        may cause conflicts in receiving areas. Indeed, even within a country, climate change could lead 
        to higher inequality due to slow economic growth in particular areas. As a result, political 
        instability could rise due to climate-related risk issues, both within and between countries.
        
        The amazon rainforest is a critical carbon sink and biodiversity hotspot, but faces significant threats 
        from physical effects of climate change, as well as in a world where transition policy is lacking to 
        defend the land use. Fires and droughts in particular cause extensive damage to ecosystems that are 
        not fire adapted, such as rainforests and wetlands, and lead to large releases of carbon dioxide 
        and air pollutants that impact health outcomes in and beyond the borders of Brazil. Meanwhile a 
        lack of valuing carbon sinks would lead to further exploitation and deforestation of Brazil’s 
        rainforests, leading to fragmentation and habitat loss that ultimately could collapse the 
        rainforest into a die-back. This would involve a loss of the self-sustainability of rains, 
        furthering the die-off of the rainforest and having significant regional and global climate 
        risks to agriculture and rainfall patterns. Meanwhile the remaining forests and tropical peatlands 
        would in a dry-off convert to carbon sources, leading to significant carbon and methane emissions 
        and a rapid increase in warming.
        
        Deforestation and other stresses are likely to have further impacts on indigenous 
        communities who come into conflict with commercial interests which exploit the forests 
        that make up their traditional lands, as well as the collapse of biodiversity and ecosystem 
        services such as water purification, soil erosion control, or agricultural production.

        **GDP growth effect**
  
        In a high physical risk scenario, global mean temperatures compared to pre-industrial 
        levels could increase across the world by 1.5°C by 2030, and 1.9°C, by 2050 C by 2050 
        and ultimately 2.3°C to 3°C by 2100 (with land warming faster than oceans and high 
        latitudes experiencing higher warming). These changes could lead to chronic changes 
        in living conditions affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, 
        and sea-level rise. It can also further change the frequency and severity of weather 
        events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.
        
        This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues are 
        dependent on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal expenditures. 
        Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. 
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a 
        high physical risk scenarios (i.e. Hot House World) on Brazil’s GDP, from chronic physical effects, 
        would be significant, ranging from -16.3% to -20.3 % (relative to a baseline with no physical risks) by 2050.
  
        This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues are
        dependent on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal expenditures.
        Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal
        revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, a Hot House World scenario with high physical risk
        could result in significant GDP losses. In a Hot House World scenario, world  GDP losses from chronic
        physical and transition effects are estimated to be between -5.7 and -6% (relative to a baseline with
        no transition or physical risks) by 2050. World GDP losses from physical risks vary in line with different
        temperatures projected for each scenario. Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), 
        the expected impact of a Hot House World scenario on Brazil's GDP from chronic physical and transition effects
        would be significant, ranging from -6.1% to -6.8% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks)
        by 2050.

NiGEM NGFS v1.24.2 [REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8.].](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads) For NGFS “Current Policies”, there are no estimated GDP loses from transition risk, so a combined is not available. Physical damages have been plotted but this causes an underestimate of the true damages to the GDP for the “Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)” scenario and for the existing transition risks facing the economy in a “Current Policies” scenario.
        
        Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including climate resilience 
        investments (e.g. to cope with flooding risks that would propel the growth of economic 
        sectors providing the underlying solutions in terms of products and services).
        
        
        **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**
  
        Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. 
        No sovereign has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related risks it faces, 
        although rating agencies anticipate that climate trends will have implications for 
        ratings in coming decades. According to the 2021 [Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rising_Climate_Falling_Ratings_Working_Paper.pdf) 
        from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, in a RCP 8.5 (i.e. high physical risk scenario), 
        most developed countries would be significantly downgraded, with an average downgrade exceeding 
        two notches by 2100. Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. Brazil would have a 
        downgrade of between 1 and 2 notches by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for 
        the Brazilian government by approximately US$1.27-1.91bn.

        In the high physical and transition risk scenarios, physical risks would undermine GDP 
        growth due to increased loss of life, land degradation, risks to crop yields, depletion of 
        natural resources, reduced productivity of the workforce, increased damages to infrastructure, etc. 
        This would have a negative impact on sovereign bonds. Unorganised and delayed climate action leads 
        to increased transition risks, as a lack of effective price signalling and coordination causes 
        supply chain bottlenecks and poor asset valuations and associated decision-making.
      always: |
        In a high physical and transition risk scenario (i.e. too little too late), physical risks 
        would undermine GDP growth due to loss of land, changing crop yields, depleted natural resources, 
        lower productivity of the workforce, damages to infrastructure, etc. Chronic and acute risks could 
        result in lower tax revenues or higher insurance premiums. This would result in a material negative 
        impact on GDP globally by 2100 and hit governments’ finances. Extreme weather events such as wildfires, 
        floods, and heat waves could become more prevalent, impacting households, businesses, cities and states. 
        There are also likely indirect risks, such as those caused by international migration (e.g. increased 
        inequalities, labour right issues, social conflicts), or via biodiversity loss, or to industries’ 
        supply chains and international trade.
        
        The high physical and transition risk scenario could lead to a significant reduction in GDP growth. 
        This would have a negative impact on Brazilian sovereign bonds.
        
        As global temperatures rise in a high physical and transition risk scenario, the effects of climate 
        change, including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in drylands and water scarcity, will likely 
        lead to changes in patterns of human migration. Climate migration could lead to increasing political 
        instability. With people in less developed countries more likely to leave affected areas, this may 
        cause conflicts in receiving areas. Indeed, even within a country, climate change could lead to 
        higher inequality due to slow economic growth in particular areas. As a result, political instability 
        could rise due to climate-related risk issues, both within and between countries.
        
        Wet bulb temperatures, which combine heat and humidity, could reach levels that make outdoor work 
        unsafe in some regions. This would severely impact labour productivity, especially in sectors like 
        agriculture and construction, where outdoor work is prevalent. 
        
        A study at the University of Exeter ([Hot weather hits productivity – even in air-conditioned factories - News](https://news.exeter.ac.uk/research/hot-weather-hits-productivity-even-in-air-conditioned-factories/)) 
        further found that productivity dropped even in air-conditioned factories. For example, productivity dropped 
        by 5.8% when wet-bulb temperatures exceeded 28°C.
        
        Divergent and delayed climate policies could exacerbate these impacts by creating inconsistent 
        regulatory environments and economic disruptions. These inconsistencies can lead to higher operational 
        costs for businesses, impacting employment and economic stability. Additionally, the lack of cohesive 
        policy frameworks may hinder the effectiveness of climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, further 
        exacerbating the risks associated with climate change.
        
      high_materiality: |
        There would be high transition and physical risks from a too-little-too-late scenario as 
        a result of the delayed (“too late”) implementation and ultimately diverging in their mitigation 
        stringency, thus rendering the overall efforts insufficient to reach net zero (“too little”). Brazil’s 
        existing decarbonisation pledges and net-zero targets would only be partially achieved, while other 
        countries follow a mix of current policies, and inadequate expansions of these polices, leading to 
        increased regional inequality which would exacerbate regional tensions as well as the physical risk impacts.
  
        **Carbon tax effect**
  
        Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure to carbon intensive 
        sectors and technologies. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors such as oil and gas are 
        consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition risk.
        
        The impact of a Too-little-too-late scenario on fiscal revenues is largely dependent 
        on the efficiency of government spending in trying to mitigate these risks. While the 
        use of taxes to incentivize more environmentally friendly production, transportation 
        and consumption patterns can help economies transition to a net zero scenario, a poorly 
        managed transition policy could lead to shocks in economic activity. Depending on the 
        respective country’s size of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, green policies, 
        such as carbon taxes would impact, positively or negatively, firms’ profitability, 
        which would, in turn, impact fiscal revenues.
        
        In the High physical and transition risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario, late and uncoordinated 
        policy reaction means that a ‘Business as Usual’ approach to decarbonisation occurs between now 
        and 2030, followed by a somewhat subdued increase in policy aggression, equivalent to an 
        implicit/proxy carbon price increase to ~115 USD per tonne CO₂ by 2035 and ~678 USD by 
        2050 based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs). The delayed 
        policy ambition reduces the initial disincentivisation against fossil fuels, only to begin 
        penalising emissions and thus risk stranding fossil fuel assets beyond 2030. In this scenario, 
        disorderly policy action results in increased transition risks.

        **GDP growth effect**
  
        In a high physical and transition risk scenario (i.e. too little too late), global mean temperatures 
        compared to pre-industrial levels could increase across the world by 1.5&deg;C by 2030, by 1.9&deg;C by 2050 
        and ultimately 2.4&deg;C by 2100 (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing 
        higher warming). These changes will lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, 
        labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea-level rise, which will consequently impact 
        the rate of growth in GDP. It can also change the frequency and severity of weather events such 
        as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.
        
        Research from Burke et al (2015) indicates there is a non-linear effect of increasing temperature on 
        economic output, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13°C and declining 
        strongly at higher temperatures. In a high physical risk scenario, unmitigated warming is expected 
        to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes by roughly 23% by 2100, relative 
        to scenarios without climate change.
        
        This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues are dependent on 
        economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal expenditures. Assuming taxation 
        rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. Based on the 
        IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a Fragmented World 
        (too-little-too-late) scenario on Brazil’s GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects, would 
        be significant, around -20% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050.

        **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**
  
        Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. No sovereign 
        has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related risks it faces, although rating agencies 
        anticipate that climate trends will have implications for ratings in coming decades. According to 
        the 2021 [Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rising_Climate_Falling_Ratings_Working_Paper.pdf)
        from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, in a high physical risk scenario, most developed countries 
        would be significantly downgraded, with an average downgrade exceeding two notches by 2100. Most downgrades 
        would be among top-rated countries. According to the study, in a high physical risk (RCP 8.5) scenario, 
        Brazil would have a downgrade of between 1 and 2 notches by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for 
        the Brazilian government by approximately US$1.27-1.91bn.
        
        **Transition impacts**
  
        Transition Impacts corresponding to a High Transition and Physical Risk (Too-Little-Too-Late) scenario include:
        
          - **Inconsistent regulatory environments**: Divergent climate policies could lead to regulatory uncertainty, 
          making it difficult for businesses to plan and invest. For example, mixed messages on carbon pricing and 
          the slow implementation of climate policies in Brazil leading to business uncertainty, especially in 
          agriculture and forestry.
          
          - **Macroeconomic disruptions**: Delayed and fragmented policies may cause economic instability, 
          affecting various sectors differently and leading to uneven growth.
          
          - **Higher operational costs**: Businesses may face increased costs due to the need to comply 
          with varying regulations and invest in climate adaptation measures.
          
          - **Impact on employment**: Economic disruptions and higher operational costs could lead 
          to job losses and reduced employment opportunities.
          
          - **Ineffective climate adaptation and mitigation**: Lack of cohesive policy frameworks 
          may hinder efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change, exacerbating physical risks. 
          
          - **Increased inequality and regional tensions**: Fragmented policies could lead to disparities 
          in climate action, exacerbating social and economic inequalities and regional tensions. Regional 
          disparities across Brazilian communities (in particular, between communities tied to forestry or 
          indigenous communities, and those communities where primary employment lies in mining, ranching, 
          and oil and gas extraction) highlight significant inequalities and internal tension, with some 
          areas facing higher unemployment and lower incomes, which could be worsened by uneven climate action.
