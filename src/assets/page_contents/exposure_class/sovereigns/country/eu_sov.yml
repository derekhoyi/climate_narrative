        In the Delayed Transition scenario, late policy reaction, societal change 
        and national energy strategies could lead to significant, albeit delayed 
        increases in the implicit carbon prices. This could have an impact on 
        sovereign bonds in countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil 
        fuel energy sources as well as a risk of short-term investment shocks.
        
      always: |
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, late policy action means that a 
        ‘Business-as-Usual’ approach to decarbonisation occurs between now 
        and 2030, followed by a sharp increase in policy aggression. The 
        delayed policy ambition reduces the initial disincentivisation against 
        fossil fuels, only to more aggressively penalise and thus risk stranding 
        fossil fuel assets beyond 2030. In this scenario, disorderly policy action 
        results in increased transition risks.
        
        These scenarios could have a very strong impact on fiscal revenues in countries 
        with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources. Industries 
        that are negatively impacted by transition risk, such as mining, oil and gas 
        could have reduced revenues from lower fossil fuel demand and increased costs 
        from significantly higher carbon taxes. Countries with high energy intensity 
        or high fossil-fuel extraction include Estonia, Bulgaria, Czechia, Greece and 
        Poland. Countries with low energy intensity, such as Austria, Finland, France, 
        Spain and Sweden are less vulnerable to transition risk.
        
        On the other hand, government spending (through subsidies and investment) could 
        encourage consumer spending and investment in the use of renewables, energy 
        efficiency, energy storage, etc, leading to increases in fiscal revenues. 
        The Delayed transition risk scenarios could also lead to a reduction in 
        GDP growth. This would have a negative impact on EU sovereign bonds.

        **Carbon tax effect**
        
        Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure 
        to carbon-intensive sectors and technologies. Countries with carbon-intensive 
        sectors such as oil and gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition risk.
        
        The impact from Delayed transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues are largely dependent 
        on the efficiency of government spending in trying to mitigate these risks. While the use 
        of taxes to incentivize more environmentally friendly production, transportation and 
        consumption patterns can help economies transition to a net-zero scenario, a poorly 
        managed transition policy could lead to shocks in economic activity. Depending on the 
        size of a country's fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, green policies like carbon 
        taxes can impact firms' profitability either positively or negatively. This, in turn, 
        would impact fiscal revenues (for more detail see
        [How could climate change impact sovereign risk](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/research/How%20could%20climate%20change%20impact%20sovereign%20risk%20FINAL.pdf)).
        
        Based on data from IEA (see below graph), in 2022, the share of renewables 
        (hydro, solar PV, solar thermal wind, geothermal and tide) in Europe’s power 
        sector increased to ~ 36%, (around 2% above the 2021 levels) driven in part by 
        increased electricity generated from Solar PV ~ 6% (2021: ~ 5%) and Wind 
        generation ~ 14% (2021: ~12%). The mix was also impacted by Nuclear which 
        dropped from ~ 21% to ~ 19% of the overall electricity generation due primarily 
        to reactor maintenance and repairs in France (see Eurostat article). The share 
        of electricity from fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) amounted to ~ 40% 
        in 2022 which is slightly up on 2021 levels driven by the reduced generation 
        from Nuclear as well as increases in coal generation ~ 17% (2021: ~ 16%). This 
        was offset partially by reduced natural gas generation ~ 21% (2021: ~ 22%). 
        These numbers include UK.

        In July 2021, the European Commission presented its “Fit for 55” package of 
        policy proposals to achieve a reduction of EU emissions by at least 55% by 
        2030 compared to 1990 levels. The package also includes proposals for a 
        higher share of renewables in the overall energy mix (40% by 2030) and 
        increased energy efficiency. The REPowerEU plan, put forward in May 2022, 
        proposes to increase the share of renewables in final energy by 2030 from 
        40% to 45%. Policies implemented to date would only result in emissions 
        reductions between 36-47%. This difference is the result of national 
        policies lagging policies adopted at the EU level.
        
        In response to the ongoing energy crisis, the EU and its member states have been 
        signing agreements for scaling up fossil gas imports from around the world and 
        have been making new investments in fossil gas infrastructure, especially new 
        liquid natural gas import terminals and gas pipelines. Such investment will only 
        shift energy dependency from Russia to other countries, and result in carbon 
        lock-in contrary to the EU’s emissions reduction goals.
  
        **GDP growth effect**
        
        A change in a country’s GDP could impact the level of fiscal revenue it receives. 
        Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a 
        reduction in fiscal revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, Delayed 
        transition could result in significant GDP losses. World GDP impacts from 
        transition risks are negative as the speed of the transition combines with 
        investment uncertainty and affects consumption and investment.
        
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected 
        impact of a Delayed Transition scenario on European GDP, from chronic physical and 
        transition effects, would be significant particularly in the longer-term, ranging 
        from -4% by 2030 (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) 
        and -9% by 2050.

        **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**
        
        Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign 
        bond market. No country has been downgraded due to climate-related 
        risks so far, although rating agencies anticipate that climate trends 
        could have implications for ratings in coming decades. According to the 
        2021 [Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness] (https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rising_Climate_Falling_Ratings_Working_Paper.pdf) 
        working paper from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, in the Delayed 
        transition scenario, most EU countries would be marginally downgraded 
        (1 notch or less). Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. 
        This does not necessarily reflect increased climate-related risks for 
        these top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity of the top ratings. 
        It is easier to lose an AAA rating than a C rating.
        
        According to the study, in a transition risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, Germany & 
        France would have a downgrade below one notch by 2100, increasing the cost 
        of borrowing for the German government by approximately US$0.23-0.35bn and 
        for the French government by approximately US$1.35-2.02b.

        In Orderly scenarios, immediate policy reaction, societal change and national energy 
        strategies could lead to significant increases decarbonisation efforts, represented by 
        implicit carbon prices. This could have an impact on sovereign bonds in countries with 
        a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources.

        In Orderly scenarios, immediate policy reaction, societal change and national 
        energy strategies could lead to significant and immediate decarbonisation policies, 
        increasing effective carbon prices. This could have a strong impact on fiscal revenues 
        in countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources. 
        Industries/sectors that are negatively impacted by transition risk, such as mining, 
        oil and gas could face reduced revenues from lower fossil fuel demand and increased 
        costs from higher carbon taxes.
        
        Countries with high energy intensity or high fossil-fuel extraction, including Estonia, 
        Bulgaria, Czechia, Greece and Poland, are more vulnerable in these scenarios. Conversely, 
        countries with low energy intensity, such as Austria, Finland, France, Spain and Sweden are 
        less vulnerable to transition risk, as these countries typically have more efficient energy 
        use and a higher share of renewable energy in their energy mix, which makes them less 
        dependent on fossil fuels and less exposed to the risks associated with the transition 
        to a low-carbon economy.
        
        On the other hand, government spending in the EU (through subsidies and investment) 
        could encourage consumer spending and investment in the use of renewables, energy 
        efficiency, energy storage, etc, leading to increases in fiscal revenues. These 
        scenarios could lead to a limited relative reduction in GDP growth. This would have a 
        limited / neutral impact on EU sovereign bonds.

        negative in the Net Zero 2050 scenario as negative impacts on demand from higher

        revenues into government investment and lower employment taxes.

        In a high physical risk scenario, physical risks would undermine GDP growth 
        due to increased loss of life, land degradation, risks to crop yields, depletion 
        of natural resources, reduced productivity of the workforce, increasing damages to 
        infrastructure, etc. Chronic and acute risks could result in lower tax revenues or 
        higher insurance premiums. This could result in a negative impact on GDP globally 
        by 2100 and hit governments’ finances. Extreme weather events such as wildfires, 
        floods, and heat waves could become more prevalent, impacting households, 
        businesses, cities and states. There are also likely indirect risks, such as 
        those caused by international migration (e.g. increased inequalities, labour 
        right issues, social conflicts), or via biodiversity loss, or to industries’ 
        supply chains and international trade. The high physical risk scenario could 
        lead to a significant reduction in GDP growth. This would have a negative 
        impact on EU sovereign bonds.
        
        As global temperatures rise in a high physical risk scenario, the effects of 
        climate change, including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in drylands and 
        water scarcity, will likely lead to changes in patterns of human migration. 
        Climate migration could lead to increasing political instability. With people 
        in less developed countries more likely to leave affected areas, this may cause 
        conflicts in receiving areas. Indeed, even within a country, climate change could 
        lead to higher inequality due to slow economic growth in particular areas. As a 
        result, political instability could rise due to climate-related risk issues, 
        both within and between countries.
  
      high_materiality: |
        **GDP growth effect**
        
        In a high physical risk scenario, global mean temperatures compared to 
        pre-industrial levels could increase across the world by 1.5&deg;C by 2030, 
        by 1.9&deg;C to 2&deg;C by 2050 and ultimately 2.3&deg;C to 3&deg;C by 2100 (with land 
        warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experience higher warming). 
        These changes will lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting 
        health, labour productivity, agriculture as well as impacting ecosystems and 
        result in sea-level rise, which will all consequently impact the rate of growth 
        in GDP. It can also further change the frequency and severity of weather events 
        such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.
        
        This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues 
        are dependent on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to 
        fiscal expenditures. Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP 
        could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer 
        NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of high physical risk on European GDP, 
        from chronic physical effects, would be significant, ranging from -4% by 2030 (relative 
        to a baseline with no physical risks) and between -8% and -10% by 2050.

NiGEM NGFS v1.24.2 [REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8.].](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads) For NGFS “Current Policies”, there are no estimated GDP loses from transition risk, so a combined is not available. Physical damages have been plotted but this causes an underestimate of the true damages to the GDP for the “Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)” scenario and for the existing transition risks facing the economy in a “Current Policies” scenario.
    
        Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including climate resilience 
        investments (e.g. to cope with flooding risks that would propel the growth of economic 
        sectors providing the underlying solutions in terms of products and services).

        working paper from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, in a high physical 
        risk scenario, most developed countries would be significantly downgraded, with 
        an average downgrade exceeding two notches by 2100. Most downgrades would be 
        among top-rated countries. According to the study, in a high physical risk 
        scenario (RCP 8.5), Germany would have a downgrade exceeding three notches by 2100, 
        increasing the cost of borrowing for the German government by approximately US$3.7-5.5bn. 
        France would have a downgrade exceeding two notches by 2100, increasing the cost 
        of borrowing for the French government by approximately US$3.9-5.9bn.

        In the high physical and transition risk scenarios, physical risks would undermine GDP 
        growth due to increased loss of life, land degradation, risks to crop yields, depletion of 
        natural resources, reduced productivity of the workforce, increased damages to infrastructure, etc. 
        This would have a negative impact on sovereign bonds. Unorganised and delayed climate action leads 
        to increased transition risks, as a lack of effective price signalling and coordination causes 
        supply chain bottlenecks and poor asset valuations and associated decision-making.
        
      always: |
        In a high physical and transition risk scenario (i.e. too-little-too-late), 
        physical risks such as loss of land, changing crop yields, depleted natural 
        resources, lower productivity of the workforce, damages to infrastructure 
        could undermine GDP growth. Extreme weather events such as wildfires, floods, 
        and heat waves could become more prevalent, impacting households, businesses, 
        cities and states. There are also likely indirect risks, such as those caused 
        by international migration (e.g. increased inequalities, labour right issues, 
        social conflicts), or via biodiversity loss, or to industries’ supply chains 
        and international trade. These factors could lead to a significant reduction 
        in GDP growth, negatively affecting EU sovereign bonds and increasing political 
        instability due to climate-related issues. 
        
        Divergent and delayed climate policies could exacerbate these impacts by creating 
        inconsistent regulatory environments and economic disruptions. These inconsistencies 
        can lead to higher operational costs for businesses, impacting employment and economic 
        stability. Additionally, the lack of cohesive policy frameworks may hinder the 
        effectiveness of climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, further exacerbating 
        the risks associated with climate change.
  
      high_materiality: |
        There would be high transition and physical risks from a too-little-too-late 
        scenario as a result of the delayed (“too late”) implementation and ultimately 
        diverging in their mitigation stringency, thus rendering the overall efforts 
        insufficient to reach net zero (“too little”). Countries in Europe with net 
        zero targets achieve these only partially, while other countries follow current 
        policies leading to increased regional inequality which would exacerbate regional 
        tensions as well as the physical risk impacts. The delays and lack of coordination 
        in policy ambition also lead to increased costs as supply chains face bottlenecks 
        and lack the capacity for meeting the demands of the transition, and price 
        signalling is insufficient early on to enable investments in the enabling 
        low-carbon infrastructure or economy.
  
        **GDP growth effect**
  
        In the high physical and transition risk scenario (i.e. too-little-too-late), 
        global mean temperatures compared to pre-industrial levels could increase across 
        the world by 1.5°C by 2030, by 1.9°C by 2050 and ultimately 2.4°C by 2100 (with 
        land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experience higher warming). 
        These changes will lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, 
        labour productivity, agriculture as well as impacting ecosystems and result in 
        sea-level rise, which will all consequently impact the rate of growth in GDP. 
        It can also change the frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, 
        droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.
        
        Research from Burke et al (2015) indicates there is a non-linear effect of 
        increasing temperature on economic output, with productivity peaking at an 
        annual average temperature of 13°C and declining strongly at higher temperatures. 
        In a high physical risk (RCP 8.5) scenario, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape 
        the global economy by reducing average global incomes by roughly 23% by 2100, relative 
        to scenarios without climate change.
        
        This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues 
        are dependent on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal 
        expenditures. Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to 
        a reduction in fiscal revenue. Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model 
        (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a Fragmented World (too-little-too-late) scenario 
        on the European GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects, would be significant, 
        around -4% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2030 and -10% by 2050.

        Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including climate resilience investments 
        (e.g. to cope with flooding risks that would propel the growth of economic sectors providing 
        the underlying solutions in terms of products and services).
  
        **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**
  
        Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. 
        No country has been downgraded due to climate-related risks so far, although 
        rating agencies anticipate that climate trends will have implications for ratings 
        in coming decades. According to the 
        2021 [Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rising_Climate_Falling_Ratings_Working_Paper.pdf)
        working paper from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy, in a 
        high physical risk scenario, most developed countries would be significantly 
        downgraded, with an average downgrade exceeding two notches by 2100. Most 
        downgrades would be among top-rated countries. According to the study, in a 
        high physical risk scenario (RCP 8.5), Germany would have a downgrade exceeding 
        three notches by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the German government 
        by approximately US$3.7-5.5bn. France would have a downgrade exceeding two notches 
        by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the French government by approximately 
        US$3.9-5.9bn.
        
        **Transition impacts**
  
        Transition Impacts corresponding to a High Transition and Physical Risk (Too-Little-Too-Late) scenario include:
        
          - **Inconsistent regulatory environments**: Divergent climate policies could lead 
          to regulatory uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to plan and invest. 
          For example, mixed messages on carbon pricing and the slow implementation of climate 
          policies across Europe have created uncertainty for businesses, particularly in the 
          energy and manufacturing sectors.
          
          - **Economic disruptions**: Delayed and fragmented policies may cause economic instability, 
          affecting various sectors differently and leading to uneven growth.
          
          - **Higher operational costs**: Businesses may face increased costs due to the need to comply 
          with varying regulations and invest in climate adaptation measures.
          
          - **Impact on employment**: Economic disruptions and higher operational costs could lead 
          to job losses and reduced employment opportunities.
          
          - **Ineffective climate adaptation and mitigation**: Lack of cohesive policy frameworks 
          may hinder efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change, exacerbating physical risks. 
          
          - **Increased inequality and regional tensions**: Fragmented policies could lead to 
          disparities in climate action, exacerbating social and economic inequalities and 
          regional tensions. Regional disparities across Europe (for example the East-West divide) 
          highlight significant regional disparities, with some areas facing higher unemployment and 
          lower incomes, which could be worsened by uneven climate action.
