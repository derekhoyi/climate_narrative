      # Property Underwriting 
	  
	  The **property underwriting** class covers a very wide range of asset types 
	  and coverages, with risk transfers flowing from the policyholders, through 
	  to insurers, reinsurers and retrocessional reinsurers, and with both simple 
	  (e.g. direct) and complex risk sharing arrangements between multiple parties, 
	  for example through bordereau and other aggregate risk products. Underwriting 
	  is the act of accepting liability up to a specified amount in an insurance policy, 
	  and generally, property insurance could be related to either fixed, immovable 
	  assets such as buildings or movable property, such as transport or goods in 
	  transit, in both personal (e.g. residential/domestic) and professional 
	  (e.g. landlords, commercial real estate, industrial real estate) settings.

	      In the Delayed Transition scenario, the increase in carbon price along 
	      with a change to the demand in the quality of real estate is likely to 
	      influence insurance products’ pricing, terms and conditions and coverage. 
	      There is likely to be an increasing pressure on insurers to decline cover 
	      for high GHG emitting industrial or commercial activities.
	      
	    always: |
	      In the Delayed transition scenario, the demand for real estate is likely 
	      to increase. While the property underwriting class could continue to play 
	      a role in meeting customer demand for the coming years, the late policy 
	      action under the Delayed transition scenario beyond 2030 could lead to a 
	      relative reduction in GDP growth. This could partially offset any growth 
	      in demand. 
	
	      Under most transition scenarios, there is likely to be an increasing pressure 
	      on insurers to decline cover for high GHG emitting industrial or commercial 
	      activities, which in turn could influence the overall underwriting strategy 
	      employed within non-life property insurers. National and international legislative 
	      actions, for example in determining premium rates may affect future underwriting 
	      strategies.
	
	    high_materiality: |
	      The changes in carbon pricing, societal preference, energy prices and
	      energy mix could potentially result in one or more of the following
	      impacts on the property underwriting class:
	
	      - **Stranded assets:** changes in underwriting rules regarding excluded 
	      or stranded asset types, including fossil fuel or other carbon-intensive 
	      industrial or commercial activities and assets. This could include reference 
	      to relevant green taxonomies which would be incorporated into underwriting 
	      strategies and might vary by region depending on the development of relevant 
	      taxonomy (e.g. EU taxonomy for sustainable activities).
	      
	      -	**Changes in consumer behaviour:** changes to the demand for insurance 
	      products due to changes in consumer behaviour (e.g. increased demand for 
	      EPC A or BREEAM excellent buildings) or national or international policy 
	      changes regarding transition rules and expectations.
	      
	      -	**Increased regulatory oversight and sanctions for non-compliant insurance 
	      companies.:** there is also potential legal or other liability risks, and 
	      associated reputational risks, due to inadequate transition strategies.
	      
	      -	**Reinsurance coverage:** inability to secure reinsurance coverage 
	      (either availability of capital, or exclusions) for insured risks which 
	      are not in line with industry Net Zero commitments.
	      
	      -	**Growth of decarbonisation technology:** opportunities arising from 
	      the development of new classes of assets and risk transfer requirements, 
	      e.g., through technological and social changes influencing product design 
	      and insurance capacity.
	      
	     The specific nature of the climate related transition risks and opportunities 
	     could vary widely. The underwriting processes followed could be designed 
	     to reflect the needs of each property class, for example, domestic household 
	     versus commercial real estate or industrial insurance. The level of exposure 
	     by property sector could therefore vary significantly. In general terms, a 
	     differentiation between residential/domestic and commercial/industrial property 
	     can be made to illustrate potential consideration with respect to transition 
	     risks from climate change. 
	     
	     Contractual terms, including exclusions (e.g. insurance ‘wordings’), play an 
	     important role in determining the level of cover, and hence exposure either 
	     retained by the policyholder, or ceded to insurers and reinsurers. This 
	     could also vary widely depending on the type of assets being insured, the 
	     territorial coverage of the assets and the insurance policy in place. 
	     
	     Transition risks can influence contractual policy wordings both through a 
	     company’s risk appetite, but also through market standards which can themselves 
	     be influenced by transition risk considerations. The uncertainty which surrounds 
	     the likely rate and direction of the transition to Net Zero, alongside the evolving 
	     regulatory, consumer and technological environments which influence insurance 
	     product design and risk assessments, mean that the ability to determine likely 
	     materiality from transition risk, could be limited by the availability of 
	     information that adequately reflects the possible outcomes over the near and 
	     longer timescales. The geographic extents and territorial coverage of insured 
	     assets, as well as the domicile of the insurer, by determining the legislative 
	     and supervisory environment which it is operating within, could also influence 
	     the materiality of transition risks and hence underwriting impact.
	     
	     In the Delayed Transition scenario, buildings increase their use of electricity 
	     over time from between 50 to 55 exajoules (EJ) in 2025 to between over 90 EJ in 
	     2050, while natural gas consumption decreases from between 25 to 30 EJ in 2025 
	     to below 15 EJ in 2050.

	     In the Delayed Transition scenario, as carbon price increases, carbon tax paid 
	     from buildings’ emissions peaks at ~$360 billion around 2035 in the Delayed 
	     Transition scenario. Carbon tax paid begins to decrease thereafter as 
	     improvements are made to buildings’ emissions intensities.

	     The profitability of the property underwriting class could depend on the 
	     relevant companies proactively addressing transition risks through mitigating 
	     actions. For example:
	     
	     -	Developing a clear net-zero underwriting strategy based on industry standards 
	        such as the [Net Zero Insurance Alliance](https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-insurance/)
	     
	     -	Applying a range of scenarios reflecting the most likely range of socio-economic, 
	        legislative technological and consumer futures within the risk appetite, and 
	        underwriting strategies applied across all property lines of business, especially 
	        in the likely influences on changing portfolio structure, and diversification options.
	     
	     -	Ensuring underwriting rules and policies are aligned to corporate and industry 
	        wide Net Zero objectives.
	     
	     -	Encouraging policy holder’s approaches to risk mitigation and transition 
	        strategies through increased knowledge transfer and remediation advisories, 
	        as well as new product development, for example to support Orderly transition 
	        to agreed timescales for high GHG emitting assets and activities.
	
	        The underwriting function within most insurers and reinsurers could need to consider 
	        a wide range of potential impacts, through both the pricing of insurance (e.g., setting 
	        the technical rate and premium required based on estimated loss potential) and the 
	        management of the insurer or reinsurer’s aggregate exposure to losses 
	        (e.g., to large losses from multiple claims occurring due to a natural disaster). 
	        The specific underwriting process followed, and the considerations made by an 
	        insurer or reinsurer, for example when determining underwriting authorities 
	        across the business, could depend on the risk appetite and portfolio exposure 
	        management strategy in place. Commercial underwriting decisions related to price 
	        and capacity could be influenced by transition risk considerations, as these 
	        could either directly affect the selection and acceptance of risk (through the 
	        inclusion of conditions such as exclusions or retention in a specific policy) or 
	        influence aggregate limits and share and line sizes, as well as directly affect the 
	        premium rate set, whether technically and risk-aligned, or due to market, regulatory 
	        or consumer demand drivers. In addition, rating and shareholder drivers could also 
	        influence insurance underwriting decisions, either in determining limits on the 
	        level of risk acceptance, or in the setting of corporate risk appetite and 
	        capital.
	        
	        The importance of data analysis and modelling for assessing transition risks to make 
	        more informed decisions is critical. By leveraging climate-related data, insurers 
	        can identify vulnerable assets, forecast potential financial losses, and develop 
	        strategies to mitigate these risks. Additionally, integrating scenario analysis 
	        helps insurers understand the long-term implications of different regulatory and 
	        market developments, allowing them to adjust their underwriting practices and pricing 
	        strategies accordingly.

	      In Orderly transition scenarios, the increase in carbon price 
	      along with a change to the demand in the quality of real estate are likely

	    always: |
	      While the property underwriting class could continue to play a role in 
	      meeting customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in 
	      energy generation in an Orderly transition risk scenario, driven by 
	      immediate policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, 
	      and carbon legislation, could lead to an immediate but smooth reduction 
	      in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050. The increase in carbon price along with a 
	      change to the demand in the quality of real estate 
	      (e.g. emissions from the construction and fabric of the building, 
	      energy efficiency performance and use of lower carbon technology 
	      (especially heating and cooling)) is likely to influence insurance 
	      products’ pricing, terms and conditions and coverage.
	
	      Under most transition scenarios, there is likely to be an increasing 
	      pressure on insurers to decline cover for high GHG emitting industrial or 
	      commercial activities, which in turn could influence the overall underwriting 
	      strategy employed within non-life property insurers. In addition, national 
	      and international legislative actions, for example in determining premium 
	      rates or coverage may affect future underwriting strategies. Insurers can 
	      adapt by incorporating and expanding climate risk assessments into their 
	      underwriting processes, leveraging data analytics to evaluate the environmental 
	      impact of potential clients, and offering incentives for businesses that adopt 
	      sustainable practices.

	      The changes in carbon pricing, societal preference, energy prices and
	      energy mix could potentially result in one or more of the following
	      impacts on the property underwriting class:
	
	      - **Stranded assets:** changes in underwriting rules regarding excluded 
	        or stranded asset types, including fossil fuel or other carbon-intensive 
	        industrial or commercial activities and assets. This could include reference 
	        to relevant green taxonomies which would be incorporated into underwriting 
	        strategies and might vary by region depending on the development of 
	        relevant taxonomy (e.g. EU taxonomy for sustainable activities).
	      
	      -	**Changes in consumer behaviour:** changes to the demand for insurance 
	      products due to changes in consumer behaviour (e.g. increased demand for EPC A or 
	      BREEAM excellent buildings) or national or international policy changes regarding 
	      transition rules and expectations.
	      
	      -	**Increased regulatory oversight and sanctions for non-compliant insurance 
	      companies:** there is also potential legal or other liability risks, and associated 
	      reputational risks, due to inadequate transition strategies.
	      
	      - **Reinsurance coverage:** inability to secure reinsurance coverage 
	      (either availability of capital, or exclusions) for insured risks which 
	      are not in line with industry Net Zero commitments.
	      
	      -	**Growth in decarbonisation technology:** opportunities arising from the 
	      development of new classes of assets and risk transfer requirements, e.g., through 
	      technological and social changes influencing product design and insurance capacity.
	
	      The specific nature of the climate related transition risks and opportunities could 
	      vary widely. The underwriting processes followed could be designed to reflect the needs 
	      of each property class, for example, domestic household versus commercial real 
	      estate or industrial insurance. The level of exposure by property sector could 
	      therefore vary significantly. In general terms, a differentiation between 
	      residential/domestic and commercial/industrial property can be made to illustrate 
	      potential consideration with respect to transition risks from climate change. 
	      Contractual terms, including exclusions (e.g. insurance ‘wordings’), 
	      play an important role in determining the level of cover, and hence exposure 
	      either retained by the policyholder, or ceded to insurers and reinsurers. This 
	      could also vary widely depending on the type of assets being insured, the territorial 
	      coverage of the assets and the insurance policy in place. 
	      
	      Transition risks can influence contractual policy wordings both through a company’s 
	      risk appetite, but also through market standards which can themselves be influenced by 
	      transition risk considerations. The uncertainty which surrounds the likely rate and 
	      direction of the transition to Net Zero, alongside the evolving regulatory, consumer 
	      and technological environments which influence insurance product design and risk 
	      assessments, mean that the ability to determine likely materiality from transition 
	      risk, could be limited by the availability of information that adequately reflects 
	      the range of possible outcomes over the near and longer timescales. The geographic 
	      extents and territorial coverage of insured assets, as well as the domicile of the 
	      insurer, by determining the legislative and supervisory environment which it is 
	      operating within, could also influence the materiality of transition risks and hence 
	      underwriting impact.
	
	      In Orderly transition scenarios, buildings increase their use of electricity over 
	      time from between 50 to 60 exajoules (EJ) in 2025 to between 90 EJ and 102 EJ in 2050, 
	      while natural gas consumption decreases from between 28 to 31 EJ in 2025 to 15 and 
	      below EJ in 2050.

	      As carbon price increases, carbon tax paid from buildings’ emissions peaks at ~$443 billion 
	      (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) around 2035 in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, 
	      and below ~$151 billion around 2035 in the Below 2&deg;c scenario. Carbon tax paid begins 
	      to decrease thereafter as improvements are made to buildings’ emissions intensities 
	      in both Net Zero 2050 and low demand scenarios to be below ~$100 billion, however, 
	      it continues to increase in the below 2&deg;c scenario to be around ~$200 billion.

	      The profitability of the property underwriting class could also depend on
	      the relevant companies proactively addressing transition risks through
	      mitigating actions. For example:
	
	      - Developing a clear net-zero underwriting strategy based on industry
	        standards such as the [Net Zero Insurance Alliance](https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-insurance/).
	
	      - Applying a range of scenarios reflecting the most likely range of
	        socio-economic, legislative technological and consumer futures within
	        the risk appetite, and underwriting strategies applied across all
	        property lines of business, especially in the likely influences on
	        changing portfolio structure, and diversification options.
	
	      - Ensuring underwriting rules and policies are aligned to corporate and
	        industry wide Net Zero objectives.
	
	      - Encouraging policy holder's approaches to risk mitigation and transition
	        strategies through increased knowledge transfer and remediation
	        advisories, as well as new product development, for example to support
	        Orderly transition to agreed timescales for high GHG emitting assets and
	        activities.
	
	      The underwriting function within most insurers and reinsurers could need
	      to consider a wide range of potential impacts, through both the pricing of
	      insurance (e.g., setting the technical rate and premium required based on
	      estimated loss potential) and the management of the insurer or reinsurer's
	      aggregate exposure to losses (e.g., to large losses from multiple claims
	      occurring due to a natural disaster). The specific underwriting process
	      followed, and the considerations made by an insurer or reinsurer, for
	      example when determining underwriting authorities across the business,
	      could depend on the risk appetite and portfolio exposure management
	      strategy in place.
	
	      Commercial underwriting decisions related to price and capacity could be
	      influenced by transition risk considerations, as these could either
	      directly affect the selection and acceptance of risk (through the
	      inclusion of conditions such as exclusions or retention in a specific
	      policy) or influence aggregate limits and share and line sizes, as well as
	      directly affect the premium rate set, whether technically and
	      risk-aligned, or due to market, regulatory or consumer demand drivers. In
	      addition, rating and shareholder drivers could also influence insurance
	      underwriting decisions, either in determining limits on the level of risk
	      acceptance, or in the setting of corporate risk appetite and capital.
	      
	      The importance of data analysis and modelling for assessing transition 
	      risks to make more informed decisions is critical. By leveraging 
	      climate-related data, insurers can identify vulnerable assets, forecast 
	      potential financial losses, and develop strategies to mitigate these risks. 
	      Additionally, integrating scenario analysis helps insurers understand the 
	      long-term implications of different regulatory and market developments, 
	      allowing them to adjust their underwriting practices and pricing strategies 
	      accordingly.
	      
	physical:
	  high:
	    exec_description: |
	      In high physical risk scenarios, insurance underwriting strategies could 
	      need to assess existing, and future physical risks, not only due to the 
	      potential for future changes in the physical drivers of climate related 
	      hazards (e.g., flood intensity, frequency and extents), but also due to 
	      changes in the distribution of exposures and in the types of assets being 
	      insured. The increased severity and frequency of physical risk events will 
	      likely lead to higher premiums and coverage being removed in areas deemed 
	      uninsurable.
	
	    always: |
	      While the non-life property insurance market is generally highly exposed 
	      to physical risks, and from those related to weather extremes the actual 
	      materiality of an insurer’s portfolio and the policies it writes could 
	      however vary significantly, by geography, asset class and risk mitigation 
	      strategies in place. As most traditional property insurance policies could be 
	      short term (e.g. for one year) this has limited the level of concern applied. 
	      This does not take account of the already significant changes in potential 
	      severity, frequency, and aggregation of extreme loss causing events at the 
	      global and regional scales which the property insurance sector is already 
	      experiencing. For instance, the California wildfires in 2025 have caused 
	      significant economic and insured losses, prompting insurers to raise premiums 
	      and limit coverage availability.
	
	      This means that any insurance underwriting strategy could need to assess 
	      existing, and future, physical risk, not only due to the potential for 
	      future changes in the physical drivers of climate related hazards 
	      (e.g., flood intensity, frequency and extents), but also due to changes 
	      in the distribution of exposures due to changing underwriting plans, and 
	      changes in the types of assets being insured. 
	      
	    high_materiality: |
	      The relative materiality of physical risks to insurers and hence the impact 
	      on underwriting strategies, could vary over time, and at varying rates. The 
	      interdependency which exists between hazard, exposure and vulnerability elements 
	      of insured property assets could also influence the level of materiality experienced 
	      across a portfolio, and this could also vary over time.
	      
	      The following physical risk considerations are likely to be relevant to 
	      underwriting strategies:
	
	      - **Changing exposure accumulations at portfolio levels:** resulting from the changes 
	        to the underwriting strategies and risk appetites of the insurer. For instance, insurers 
	        may adjust their risk models to account for increased frequency and severity of natural 
	        disasters, such as hurricanes and wildfires. This can lead to higher premiums and stricter 
	        underwriting criteria, reducing the number of policies issued in high-risk areas 
	        (see further examples below).
		  
	      - **Unaffordability of insurance:** due to increased technical rates and premiums, especially 
	        due to the addition of increased uncertainty within pricing models. Regions with a high number 
	        of uninsured properties can become "insurance deserts," where obtaining coverage is extremely 
	        difficult or impossible. This can lead to broader economic impacts, including reduced investment 
	        and development in these areas. 
		  
	      - **Increased risk of underinsurance and reinsurance failure:** due to underestimation of 
	        potential losses, particularly aggregate loss from multiple occurring extreme events.
		  
	      - **Changes to the level of portfolio diversification:** achieved across an insurance property 
	        book due to varying hazard, exposure and vulnerability from climate related influences, especially 
	        due to higher frequencies of multiple loss causing events from the range of climate related impacts 
	        to properties, whether via direct physical damage or indirect Impacts to supply chains or other 
	        factors critical to the performance of the insured assets. Increased cost of capital due to increased 
	        uncertainty amongst reinsurance and other capital providers.
		  
	      - **Growth of decarbonisation technology:** opportunities for new products or lines of business 
	        reflecting changing patterns of hazard and demand for insurance cover, e.g., for climate 
	        related business interruption policies.
	
	      The specific nature of these risks could vary widely. The underwriting processes followed could be 
	      designed to reflect the needs of each property class, for example, domestic household versus commercial 
	      real estate or industrial insurance. The level of exposure by property sector could therefore vary 
	      significantly. In general terms, a differentiation between residential/domestic and commercial/industrial 
	      property can be made to illustrate potential consideration with respect to physical risks from climate 
	      change.
	      
	      In a high physical risk scenario, it may be possible that certain risks become uninsurable. 
	      This could have knock on consequences for the region meaning that properties in the area 
	      become stranded. For example, the 1-in-100 year expected damage from tropical 
	      cyclones in both Current Policies and NDCs scenarios show a significant 
	      increase over time with the % change in annual expected damage going from 
	      ~6% in 2025 to between ~18% and ~19% by 2050. The increased frequency and 
	      severity of tropical cyclones pose substantial challenges. Insurers may need 
	      to adjust their risk models and pricing strategies to account for the higher 
	      likelihood of claims. This could lead to higher premiums and stricter underwriting 
	      criteria, making it difficult for homeowners or businesses in vulnerable areas to 
	      obtain coverage.

	      Another example is the California wildfires have caused significant economic 
	      and insured losses, prompting insurers to raise premiums and limit coverage 
	      availability. In 2025, catastrophic wildfires in California resulted in 
	      significant estimated economic losses. This trend is not isolated to California; 
	      globally, the financial costs of climate-related physical risks for the world's 
	      largest companies are projected to reach $1.2 trillion annually by 2050 (see article 
	      here: [Climate Hazards Projected to Hit Companies Hard by 2050s - Risk & Insurance : 
	      Risk & Insurance](https://riskandinsurance.com/climate-hazards-projected-to-hit-companies-hard-by-2050s/)). Consequently, 
	      insurers are responding by increasing premiums and reducing coverage in high-risk areas.
	      
	      Contractual terms, including exclusions (e.g. insurance ‘wordings’), play an 
	      important role in determining the level of cover, and hence exposure either 
	      retained by the policyholder, or ceded to insurers and reinsurers. This could 
	      also vary widely depending on the type of assets being insured and the territorial 
	      coverage of the assets. Physical risks can influence contractual policy wordings 
	      both through a company’s risk appetite, but also through market standards which 
	      can themselves be influenced by physical risk considerations.
	      
	      Underwriting decisions on price, through either experience based pricing, or 
	      actuarial / model based, require considerable understanding of the potential 
	      range of losses which could impact both individual assets and policy holders, 
	      but equally the aggregate risk which the insurer is exposed to across all policies 
	      and lines of business which it provides.
	
	      The increased uncertainties, which underly the assessment of changing physical 
	      risks, mean that utilising frequency and severity distribution methods for 
	      pricing and portfolio assessment could be less effective to effectively account 
	      for future losses within premiums. The lack of consistent modelling approaches 
	      for both present day and future physical risk, particularly in emerging economies 
	      and markets, means that there could be a lower level of confidence placed on 
	      estimates of probable maximum loss. This uncertainty drives many of the physical 
	      risk considerations mentioned. The profitability of the property underwriting 
	      class could depend on the relevant companies proactively addressing physical 
	      risks through mitigating actions. For example:
	
	      - Developing improved data capture and modelling processes that more accurately 
	        represent the levels of vulnerability and resilience of insured assets to direct 
	        and indirect physical risks - both present day and future
	
	      -	Encouraging improved resiliency amongst policyholders through advisory 
	        services and risk reduction initiatives. Resilience could also be encouraged 
	        on a larger scale through influencing public policy engagement on flood 
	        defences, building regulations, local/civic planning strategy, infrastructure
	
	      -	Incorporating a forward-looking element into risk modelling and pricing tools 
	
	      -	Developing a range of realistic scenarios which reflect a range of potential 
	        future impacts on physical risk at various short, medium and long-time horizons
	
	      -	Developing policies and products which are aligned to changing consumer 
	        requirements, and physical risk profiles
	
	      -	Ensuring risk appetite and tolerance statements, and associated underwriting 
	        authorities are fully aligned to clear physical risk scenarios
	
	      The underwriting function within most insurers and reinsurers could need to 
	      consider a wide range of potential impacts, through both the pricing of insurance 
	      (e.g., setting the technical rate and premium required based on estimated loss potential) 
	      and the management of the insurer or reinsurer’s aggregate exposure to losses 
	      (e.g., to large losses from multiple claims occurring due to a natural disaster). The 
	      specific underwriting process followed, and the considerations made by an insurer or 
	      reinsurer, for example when determining underwriting authorities across the business, 
	      could depend on the risk appetite and portfolio exposure management strategy in place.
	
	      Commercial underwriting decisions related to price and capacity could be influenced 
	      by physical risk considerations, as these could either directly affect the selection 
	      and acceptance of risk (through the inclusion of conditions such as exclusions or 
	      retention in a specific policy) or influence aggregate limits and share and line 
	      sizes, as well as directly affect the premium rate set, whether technically and 
	      risk-aligned, or due to market, regulatory or consumer demand drivers. In addition, 
	      rating and shareholder drivers could also influence insurance underwriting decisions, 
	      either in determining limits on the level of risk acceptance, or in the setting of 
	      corporate risk appetite and capital.

	    exec_description: |
	      In a high physical and transition risk scenario, insurance underwriting 
	      strategies would need to assess existing, and future climate risks. This 
	      includes potential changes in climate-related hazards (e.g., flood intensity, 
	      frequency and extents), shifts in distribution of exposures, and in the types 
	      of assets being insured. The increased severity and frequency of physical risk 
	      events will likely lead to higher premiums and coverage being removed in areas 
	      deemed uninsurable. Additionally, heighted transition risks such as stringent 
	      regulations must be considered.
	
	    always: |
	      The non-life property insurance market is highly exposed to physical risks, 
	      particularly those related to weather extremes. However, the materiality of an 
	      insurer’s portfolio and the policies it writes could however vary significantly, 
	      by geography, asset class and risk mitigation strategies. Traditional property 
	      insurance policies are often short term, typically one year, which has 
	      historically limited the exposure. Nonetheless, this does not take account 
	      of the already significant changes in potential severity, frequency, and 
	      aggregation of extreme loss causing events at the global and regional scales 
	      that the property insurance sector is already experiencing. For instance, the 
	      California wildfires in 2025 have caused significant economic and insured losses, 
	      prompting insurers to raise premiums and limit coverage availability.
	
	      In a Fragmented World scenario, heightened transition risks should also be 
	      considered including National and international legislative actions, for example 
	      in determining premium rates or coverage which may affect future underwriting 
	      strategies.
	      
	      Insurance underwriting strategy should evaluate both current and future 
	      climate risk, considering potential changes in climate-related hazards 
	      (e.g., flood intensity, frequency and extents) and shifts in exposure 
	      distribution due to changing underwriting plans, and asset types.
	      
	    high_materiality: |
	      There would both high physical and transition risks from a too-little-too-late 
	      scenario as a result of the delayed (“too late”) implementation and ultimately 
	      diverging in their mitigation stringency, thus rendering the overall efforts 
	      insufficient to reach net zero (“too little”). Countries with net zero targets 
	      achieve these only partially, while other countries follow current policies 
	      leading to increased inequality which would exacerbate regional tensions as well 
	      as the physical impacts.
	
	      The materiality of physical risks to insurers and hence the impact on 
	      underwriting strategies, could vary over time, and at different rates. The 
	      interdependency which exists between hazard, exposure and vulnerability 
	      elements of insured property assets influences the level of materiality 
	      experienced across a portfolio. The following physical risk considerations 
	      are likely to be relevant to underwriting strategies:
	
	      - **Changing exposure accumulations:** at portfolio levels due to changes 
	        in underwriting strategies and risk appetites. For instance, insurers may 
	        adjust their risk models to account for increased frequency and severity 
	        of natural disasters, such as hurricanes and wildfires. This can lead 
	        to higher premiums and stricter underwriting criteria, reducing the number 
	        of policies issued in high-risk areas (see further examples below).
	      
	      -	**Unaffordability of insurance:** due to increased technical rates and 
	        premiums, especially with added uncertainty in pricing models. Regions 
	        with a high number of uninsured properties can become "insurance deserts,
	        " where obtaining coverage is extremely difficult or impossible. This can 
	        lead to broader economic impacts, including reduced investment and development 
	        in these areas.
	      
	      -	**Increased risk of underinsurance and reinsurance failure:** due to 
	        underestimation of potential losses, particularly aggregate loss from 
	        multiple occurring extremes.
	      
	      - **Changes in portfolio diversification:** due to varying hazard, exposure, 
	        and vulnerability from climate-related influences, especially higher frequencies 
	        of multiple loss-causing events.
	      
	      - **Growth in decarbonisation technology:** opportunities for new products or lines 
	        of business reflecting changing patterns of hazard and demand for insurance cover, 
	        e.g., climate-related business interruption policies.
	
	      With high physical risk it may be possible that certain risks become uninsurable. 
	      This could have knock on consequences for the region meaning that properties in 
	      the area become stranded. For example, the 1-in-100 year expected damage from 
	      tropical cyclones in the Fragmented World scenario shows a significant increase
	      over time with the % change in annual expected damage going from ~6% in 2025 
	      to ~18% by 2050. The increased frequency and severity of tropical cyclones 
	      pose substantial challenges. Insurers may need to adjust their risk models 
	      and pricing strategies to account for the higher likelihood of claims. This 
	      could lead to higher premiums and stricter underwriting criteria, making it 
	      difficult for homeowners or businesses in vulnerable areas to obtain coverage.

	      Risk & Insurance : Risk & Insurance). Consequently, insurers are responding by 
	      increasing premiums and reducing coverage in high-risk areas.
	
	      Heighted transition risks in a Fragmented World scenario include regulatory 
	      changes such as National and international legislative actions, for example 
	      in determining premium rates or coverage may affect future underwriting 
	      strategies. Stricter building codes and energy efficiency standards can 
	      increase costs for retrofitting and developing properties. For example, 
	      new regulations may require the installation of energy-efficient HVAC 
	      systems, solar panels, or green roofs, significantly increasing upfront 
	      costs as well the ability of real estate companies to afford premiums.
	
	      The specific nature of these risks could vary widely. The underwriting 
	      processes followed could be designed to reflect the needs of each property 
	      class, for example, domestic household versus commercial real estate or 
	      industrial insurance. Exposure levels by property sector can vary 
	      significantly. Differentiation between residential/domestic and 
	      commercial/industrial property illustrates potential considerations 
	      regarding physical risks from climate change.
	
	      Contractual terms, including exclusions (e.g. insurance ‘wordings’),

	      can enhance the profitability of the property underwriting class. Examples include:

	        requirements, and physical and transition risk profiles.
	      -	Ensuring risk appetite and tolerance statements, and associated underwriting

	      -	Developing a clear net-zero underwriting strategy based on industry 
	        standards such as the Net Zero Insurance Alliance.
	      -	Encouraging policy holder’s approaches to risk mitigation and transition 
	        strategies through increased knowledge transfer and remediation advisories, 
	        as well as new product development, for example to support Orderly scenarios 
	        to agreed timescales for high GHG emitting assets and activities.
	
	        The underwriting function within insurers and reinsurers must consider a 
	        wide range of potential impacts, through both the pricing of insurance 
	        (e.g., setting the technical rate and premium required based on estimated 
	        loss potential) and the management of the insurer or reinsurer’s aggregate 
	        exposure to losses (e.g., to large losses from multiple claims occurring 
	        due to a natural disaster). The specific underwriting process and considerations 
	        depend on the risk appetite and portfolio exposure management strategy in place.
	        
	        Commercial underwriting decisions related to price and capacity could be 
	        influenced by physical and transition risk considerations, affecting risk 
	        selection and acceptance, aggregate limits, share and line sizes, and premium 
	        rates. Rating and shareholder drivers could also influence insurance underwriting 
	        decisions, determining limits on risk acceptance and setting of corporate risk 
	        appetite and capital.
