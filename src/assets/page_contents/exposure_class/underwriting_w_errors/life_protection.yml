      #Life Protection Underwriting
	  
	  The **life protection** underwriting class covers term assurance, whole life assurance, mortgage protection, income protection 
	  and critical illness written on either an individual or group basis.
	  
	  Life assurance policies generally pay out a one-off payment of the cover amount on death of the life assured. Policies may 
	  be written on whole of life basis, or cover may last for a specified term. The cover amount can be flat over the term 
	  of the policy or may decrease over the policy duration.
	  
	  Critical illness policies provide the pay out on the occurrence of one of a set of predetermined conditions. Depending 
	  on the definition, payment may occur on diagnosis, when the condition has progressed to a specified severity or when 
	  certain treatments are performed.
	  
	  Income protection provides a regular income for policyholders who are unable to work due to illness or injury. 
	  Payments may last until the policyholder recovers or may be for a predetermined length of time. The main risks 
	  covered by Life Protection businesses for consumers are mortality and morbidity. The other key risks life protection 
	  businesses are exposed to are expenses, lapses and catastrophes.

	      Life protection underwriting exposures could be impacted in the Delayed transition risk scenarios, as mortality 
	      and morbidity could be affected by both a reduction in pollution which could in turn result in a reduction in 
	      cancer (especially lung), respiratory diseases, heart attack and stroke as well as potentially a decrease in 
	      healthcare spending. 
	
	    always: |
	      Life protection underwriting exposures could be impacted by the transition effects related to changes in pollution 
	      levels. In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction means that a ‘Business-as-Usual’ approach to 
	      decarbonisation occurs between now and 2030, followed by a sharp increase in policy aggression, resulting in 
	      carbon prices increasing. 
	      
	      This could lead to a significant reduction in CO₂ emissions by 2050, probably associated with a drive towards 
	      cleaner air (due to for example, an increase in electric vehicles replacing vehicles with internal combustion 
	      engines). This would cause a reduction in pollution which could in turn result into a reduction in cancer (especially lung), 
	      respiratory diseases, heart attack and stroke. These scenarios could also lead to a limited reduction in GDP growth. 
	      This could lead to significant changes in the rate of growth in healthcare spending that could negatively impact mortality and morbidity.

	      **Pollution effect**
	
	      It seems reasonable to assume that a general drive towards reducing greenhouse gases could probably be associated with a 
	      drive towards cleaner air, and therefore positive outcomes for health. However, it is important to differentiate between 
	      the production of greenhouse gases (such as CO₂ and CH4) that lead to warming but do not directly impact health, and the 
	      production of pollutants (such as particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen (NOx)) that are more directly harmful to health.
	      
	      In these scenarios, emissions of hazardous pollutants, for example black carbon, volatile organic compounds, and oxides of 
	      nitrogen, are projected to decrease. Emission trajectories for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) can be seen here, but other hazardous 
	      pollutants in the NGFS could equally be referenced as a guide as these have broadly similar trajectories.

	      Whilst it may be the case that advances in one are correlated with advancements in the other (for example if diesel cars 
	      are replaced with electric cars where the marginal electricity is generated from renewable sources), some climate outcomes 
	      may achieve one and not the other. For example:
	      
	      -	If we replace diesel cars with electric cars but continue to rely on fossil fuels to generate the electricity, then this could address the particulates but not the greenhouse effect.
	      -	If we increase biomass burning this may reduce greenhouse effect but actually contribute to local particulate pollution.
	      -	If pollution and greenhouse gases are reduced locally (e.g. in the UK) but without global buy-in, then this could also reduce the correlation.
	      
	      In the Delayed transition scenario, there is potential for fewer deaths and a positive outcome for health relating to air 
	      pollution, the reduction of pollution could result into a reduction of cancers (especially lung) and respiratory diseases 
	      (e.g. asthma, respiratory allergic disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections, but 
	      also cardiovascular disease), although we note that this is very much dependent on the fuel mix generating electrical power 
	      for the grid. For example, whilst waste-to-energy plants have similar particulate outputs to gas-fired power stations, 
	      biomass plants such as wood pellet fired facilities, for their many positives, produce significantly more particulates than 
	      gas-fired power stations (Hajat et al., 2014).
	      
	      **GDP growth effect**
	      
	      GDP growth impacts the ability of individuals and government to spend more on factors that can impact the nation’s health 
	      and thus indirectly levels of mortality and morbidity claims. The specific scenario would depend on how government and 
	      society chose to allocate any GDP growth.
	      
	      The Delayed transition scenario could lead to a moderate to severe fall in GDP growth. A slower GDP growth would potentially 
	      constrain the growth in spending on NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. Assuming that greater funding is 
	      correlated to some extent with mortality and morbidity outcomes, this means any climate scenario could have an impact on 
	      mortality and morbidity via its impact on GDP. This could impact across the range of protection products. Although the precise 
	      impact may differ between products depending on the scenario (for example, income protection claims experience might suffer 
	      more if there was a reduction in spending on musculoskeletal conditions, whilst critical illness would be more sensitive to 
	      trajectories in cancer diagnosis techniques), it may be more appropriate to view this at the “overall” level rather than 
	      spuriously defining specific GDP allocation scenarios.
	      
	      **Carbon Tax**
	      
	      In the Delayed transition scenario, global government carbon tax revenues increase in the short to medium term. Government 
	      revenue impacts the ability of governments to spend more on factors that can impact the nation’s health and thus indirectly 
	      levels of mortality and morbidity claims. The specific scenario would depend on how government and society chose to allocate 
	      revenue. However, higher revenue would give a bigger pot to potentially support higher spending on the NHS, public health, 
	      social care, medical research etc. and so it is reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater “on average” 
	      if government revenue is greater (without having to specifically predict how spending is allocated by any future government).
	      
	      **Other transition impacts**
	
	      -	**Economic disruption:** Transition policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions can lead to economic disruptions, affecting 
	      employment and income levels, which in turn could impact the affordability and demand for life protection products. For instance, 
	      the shift to renewable energy sources may result in job losses in traditional energy sectors like coal mining and coal-fired 
	      power plants. Unlike an orderly transition, the creation of new job opportunities in renewable energy industries may be slower 
	      and less effective in offsetting these negative impacts. This prolonged economic disruption can lead to reduced household incomes 
	      and decreased affordability of life protection products.
	
	      -	**Regulatory changes:** New regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions can increase operational costs for businesses, 
	      potentially affecting their ability to offer employee benefits, including life insurance. For example, the implementation of 
	      carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems can raise the cost of production for companies in high-emission sectors like manufacturing 
	      and transportation. In a delayed transition scenario, businesses may struggle more to invest in greener technologies and processes 
	      to comply with these regulations, further increasing operational expenses and potentially leading to cuts in employee benefits.
	
	      -	**Health impacts:** Transition policies can lead to changes in occupational health risks, with some industries facing higher 
	      risks due to new technologies or processes. For example, the shift to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power introduces
	      new occupational hazards. Workers in the wind energy sector may face risks associated with working at heights and handling heavy 
	      equipment, while those in the solar industry may be exposed to hazardous materials used in photovoltaic cells. Additionally, the 
	      transition to electric vehicles and battery storage technologies can introduce risks related to the handling and disposal of batteries. 
	      These changes in occupational health risks can impact morbidity and mortality rates, influencing the pricing and design of life 
	      protection products.
	      
	      **Impact on pricing or product design**
	      
	      To the extent that there is an impact on mortality, the Delayed transition risk scenarios could have an impact on the pricing of 
	      life protection products, although this is likely to be modest. Economic disruptions from transition policies may lead to job losses 
	      and reduced household incomes, impacting the affordability and demand for life protection products. Regulatory changes aimed at 
	      reducing carbon emissions could increase operational costs for businesses, potentially affecting their ability to offer employee 
	      benefits, including life insurance. Additionally, changes in occupational health risks due to new technologies or processes introduced 
	      by transition policies could influence morbidity and mortality rates. Insurers may need to adjust premiums and product designs to 
	      account for these factors, ensuring they remain competitive and adequately cover the associated risks.

	      Life protection underwriting exposures could be impacted in the Orderly scenarios, as mortality and morbidity could decrease due

	     Life protection underwriting exposures could be impacted by the transition effects related to changes in pollution levels. In 
	     Orderly scenarios, immediate policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation could lead to an

	     for example, an increase in electric vehicles replacing vehicles with internal combustion engines).

	      **Pollution effect**

	    exec_description: |
	      In high physical risk scenarios, climate change is likely to result in increased disruption that could have an impact on the 
	      life protection underwriting class, as mortality and morbidity could be affected by both a reduction in healthcare spending 
	      and an increase in a myriad of health problems due to higher temperatures.
	
	    always: |
	      In the high physical risk scenario, climate change is likely to result in increased disruption that could have an impact on 
	      life protection underwriting class. Chronic gradual impacts (such as higher average global temperatures and potentially rises 
	      in the spread of vector-borne diseases) and acute effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather events (such 
	      as floods, droughts, bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could impact mortality and morbidity risks, although this is dependent
	       on location and may not be as material in the UK. This could result in future policyholders becoming more expensive to insure.
	      
	      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed and these vary in line with different temperatures projected which 
	      could also negatively impact mortality and morbidity (for example from the GDP growth effect).
	
	    high_materiality: |
	      **GDP growth effect**
	      
	      GDP growth impacts the ability of individuals and government to spend more on factors that can impact the nation’s health and 
	      thus indirectly levels of mortality and morbidity claims. The specific scenario would depend on how government and society chose 
	      to allocate any GDP growth. However, higher GDP would give a bigger pot to potentially support higher spending on the NHS, public 
	      health, social care, medical research etc. and so it is reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater “on average” 
	      if GDP is greater (without having to specifically predict how spending is allocated by any future government). Similarly, a lower GDP 
	      would potentially constrain the growth in spending on these areas. Assuming that greater funding is correlated to some extent with 
	      mortality and morbidity outcomes, this means a climate scenario could have an impact on mortality and morbidity via its impact on GDP.
	      
	      This could impact across the range of protection products. Although the precise impact may differ between products depending on the 
	      scenario (for example, income protection claims experience might suffer more if there was a reduction in spending on musculoskeletal 
	      conditions, whilst critical illness would be more sensitive to trajectories in cancer diagnosis techniques), it may be more appropriate 
	      to view this at the “overall” level rather than spuriously defining specific GDP allocation scenarios.
	      
	      **Temperature and weather effect**
	      
	      In a high physical risk scenario, the increases in chronic climate effects such as temperature variation and weather events could pose 
	      significant challenges that in turn could impact the life protection underwriting class. For example:
	
	      -	**Mortality:** A level increase in temperature in the UK could lead to a reduction in deaths since the reduction in excess deaths due 
	      to cold weather may outweigh any increase excess deaths due to warmer weather and the risk of prolonged heat waves. However, to the extent 
	      that any increase in temperatures comes with an increase in the variability of temperatures, we could see an increase in both winter and 
	      summer excess mortality. In addition, the impact is not the same for all ages, with children and older people likely to be the most 
	      affected - given that life assurance is predominantly bought by people of working age, the exposure to higher mortality for children 
	      and older people is likely to be more limited.
	
	      -	**Morbidity:** A rise in temperatures could lead to an increase in the incidence rates of skin cancer, a condition often covered by 
	      critical illness products. The prevalence of skin cancer is dependent on geographic location so any increased prevalence may also differ 
	      by location. Furthermore, research indicates a link between high temperatures and high temperature changes with increased cardiovascular 
	      risk, e.g. heart attacks which could potentially lead to higher critical illness claims or income protection claims.
	      
	      As can be seen below, for both the Current Policies and NDC scenarios, mean air temperatures, covering both mean daily minimum and 
	      maximum air temperatures, are projected to increase in the UK.

	     **Impact on pricing or product design**
	     
	     The high physical risk scenario could have a more significant impact on the pricing of life protection products. The extent of the impact 
	     will depend on the geographical region and the severity of the temperature changes and extreme weather events. There are several mitigating 
	     actions that could be taken against the potential mortality, and morbidity impacts due to the physical risks mentioned above to build 
	     resiliency against extreme weather events. For example, offering premium discounts or other incentives for policyholders who take proactive 
	     measures to mitigate risks, such as installing storm shutters, reinforcing roofs, or creating defensible spaces around their homes to reduce 
	     wildfire risk. In addition, investing in healthcare infrastructure to ensure that hospitals and clinics are equipped to handle the increased 
	     demand during extreme weather events, including backup power systems and climate control measures.

	      In a high physical and transition risk scenario, climate change is likely to result in increased disruption impacting the life protection

	      temperatures.
	
	    always: |
	      In the high physical and transition risk scenarios, climate change is likely to result in increased disruption that could have an impact 
	      on the life protection underwriting class. Chronic gradual impacts, such as higher average temperatures and rises in the spread of

	      as material in the UK. 
	      
	      Additionally, transition impacts, such as economic disruptions from the shift to renewable energy and regulatory changes aimed at 
	      reducing carbon emissions, could further affect employment, income levels, and occupational health risks. These factors could make 
	      future prospective policyholders more expensive to insure. The too-little-too-late scenario could also lead to significant GDP impacts, 
	      negatively impacting mortality and morbidity.
	
	    high_materiality: |
	      There would both high physical and transition risks from a too-little-too-late scenario as a result of the delayed (“too late”) 
	      implementation and ultimately diverging in their mitigation stringency, thus rendering the overall efforts insufficient to reach 
	      net zero (“too little”). Countries with net zero targets achieve these only partially, while other countries follow current policies 
	      leading to increased inequality which would exacerbate regional tensions as well as the physical impacts.
	      
	      **GDP growth effect**
	      
	      GDP growth impacts the ability of individuals and government to spend more on factors that can impact the nation’s health and thus 
	      indirectly levels of mortality and morbidity claims. The specific scenario would depend on how government and society chose to allocate 
	      any GDP growth. However, higher GDP would give a bigger pot to potentially support higher spending on the NHS, public health, social 
	      care, medical research etc. and so it is reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater “on average” if GDP is 
	      greater (without having to specifically predict how spending is allocated by any future government). Similarly, a lower GDP would 
	      potentially constrain the growth in spending on these areas. Assuming that greater funding is correlated to some extent with mortality 
	      and morbidity outcomes, this means any climate scenario could have an impact on mortality and morbidity via its impact on GDP.
	      
	      This could impact across the range of protection products. Although the precise impact may differ between products depending on the 
	      scenario (for example, income protection claims experience might suffer more if there was a reduction in spending on musculoskeletal

	      The transition to a low-carbon economy could also affect life protection insurance. For example:
	      
	      -	**Economic disruption:** Transition policies could lead to economic disruptions, affecting employment and income levels, which in 
	      turn could impact the affordability and demand for life protection products. For instance, the closure of coal mines and coal-fired 
	      power plants as part of a shift to renewable energy can result in job losses for workers in these industries.
	
	      -	**Regulatory changes:** New regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions could increase operational costs for businesses, potentially 
	      affecting their ability to offer employee benefits, including life insurance. For example, the implementation of carbon taxes or 
	      cap-and-trade systems can raise the cost of production for companies in high-emission sectors like manufacturing and transportation.
	
	      -	**Health impacts:** Transition policies could lead to changes in occupational health risks, with some industries facing higher 
	      risks due to new technologies or processes. For example, the shift to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power introduces 
	      new occupational hazards. Workers in the wind energy sector may face risks associated with working at heights and handling heavy 
	      equipment, while those in the solar industry may be exposed to hazardous materials used in photovoltaic cells.
	      
	      **Impact on pricing or product design**
	      
	      To the extent that there is an impact on mortality and morbidity, the too-little-too-late scenario could affect the pricing of 
	      life protection products. There are several mitigating actions that could be taken against the potential mortality, and morbidity 
	      impacts due to the physical risks and build resilience against extreme weather events. For example, investing in more resilient 
	      solutions for heating/cooling technologies across homes and businesses, as well as integrating climate change into the medical 
	      curriculum to better equip health professionals in the face of climate change driven emergencies and extreme weather events and 
	      promoting public health initiatives that focus on climate resilience. Additionally, insurers can develop new products that specifically
	      address climate-related health risks and collaborate with governments and organizations to enhance community preparedness and response 
	      strategies. iHealth Underwriting ClassiThe health underwriting class covers personal, corporate and small to medium enterprise domestic 
	      health insurance predominantly in the UK market. Under the Solvency II definition of insurance lines of business these are reported 
	      under Medical Expense and Assistance.
	      
	      Health underwriting risk refers to the potential deviation from the actuarial assumptions used for setting insurance premium rates 
	      which could lead to premium inadequacy. Health underwriting risk should therefore consider both the setting of adequate premium 
	      rates (pricing) and the management of claims (claims) for insurance policies.
