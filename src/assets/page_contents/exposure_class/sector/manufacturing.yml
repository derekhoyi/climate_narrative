    # Manufacturing
    
    The **manufacturing** sector involves the transformation of (mainly) raw materials or substances into new products by way of mechanical, physical, or chemical processes. Manufactured products derived from the assembly of component parts also comprise the manufacturing sector - unless otherwise specified. Manufacturing establishments are typically referred to as mills, factories or plants and tend to use power-driven machinery or handling equipment in the manufacturing process, however it is not unusual for some manufacturing activities to occur in a domestic setting.
    Although, the distinction between the manufacturing sector and others can be ambiguous, hence, the inclusion of miscellaneous manufacturing as a sub-sector. The North American Industrial Code (NAIC) categorises the manufacturing sector into the following sub-sectors: 
      
    - Pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing
    
    - Paint, coating, and adhesive manufacturing
    
    - Soap, cleaning compound, and toilet preparation manufacturing
    
    - Other chemical product and preparation manufacturing
    
    - Plastics product manufacturing
    
    - Rubber product manufacturing
    
    - Glass and glass product manufacturing
    
    - Clay product and refractory manufacturing
    
    - Cement and concrete product manufacturing
    
    - Lime and gypsum product manufacturing
    
    - Other non-metallic mineral product manufacturing
    
    - Iron and steel mills and ferroalloy manufacturing
    
    - Steel product manufacturing from purchased steel
    
    - Alumina and aluminum production and processing
    
    - Nonferrous metal (except aluminum) production and processing
    
    - Agriculture, construction, and mining machinery manufacturing
  
    - Food manufacturing
  
    - Beverage and tobacco product manufacturing
  
    - Textile manufacturing (including textile product mills, apparel
      manufacturing and leather and allied product manufacturing)
  
    - Wood product manufacturing (including paper manufacturing and printing and
      related support activities)
  
    - Petroleum and coal products manufacturing
    
    - Pharmaceutical and Medicine Manufacturing (including medical equipment and supplies manufacturing)
  
    - Chemical manufacturing (including plastics and rubber products
      manufacturing)
  
    - Non-metallic mineral product manufacturing
  
    - Primary metal manufacturing (including fabricated metal product
      manufacturing and machinery manufacturing)
  
    - Computer and electronic product manufacturing (including electrical
      equipment, appliance, and component manufacturing)
  
    - Transportation equipment manufacturing (including motor, railroad rolling stock, aerospace product, ship and boat manufacturing)
  
    - Furniture and related product manufacturing.
  
    - Miscellaneous manufacturing.
    
    - Engine, turbine, and power transmission equipment manufacturing
    
    - Technology, electric and electronics manufacturing (including ventilation, heating, air-conditioning, 
      household appliance, commercial refrigeration, computer and peripheral equipment, communications equipment, 
      audio and video equipment, etc.)

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, manufacturers could benefit from new revenue streams, but face rising operating costs due to carbon pricing policies and falling asset values as current infrastructure becomes increasingly obsolete. 
      always: |
        Whilst a sizeable proportion of manufacturing activity continues to reinforce economic dependence on fossil fuels, some areas of manufacturing are increasingly supporting the transition to a lower carbon economy. This is heavily influenced by various characteristics such as the political will within a given jurisdiction, the availability of climate finance or whether there is an economic rationale to consider abatement. An example of this includes the integration of sustainable materials in apparel manufacturing to appeal to the climate conscious consumer.
      high_materiality: |
        The following examples illustrate how the manufacturing sector could be impacted in a Delayed Transition scenario:
  
        - **Increased costs:** this can occur from paying a price on carbon-intensive exports (see EU’s proposed Carbon Border Adjusted Mechanism) and rising energy costs.
  
        - **Reduced revenue:** this can occur due to decline in demand for consumer discretionary manufacturing products as abatement costs are likely passed onto the consumer.
  
        - **Falling asset values:** this can result in stranded assets in carbon-intensive manufacturing industries as the impairment of the economic value of company assets such as existing infrastructure required for transport equipment manufacturing.
  
        - **Increased revenue:** this can occur for industries that can support the global transition to Net Zero such as carbon capture storage (CCS) manufacturing.
  
        In the Delayed transition scenario, CCS utilisation is projected to increase dramatically, rising from ~67 megatons in 2030 to around ~2200 megatons of CO<sub>2</sub> being stored annually by 2050.

        Increased demand for skilled labour to support the research, development, and implementation of climate mitigation strategies.
  
        Readjusted capital expenditures new investments required to pivot business models towards low-carbon manufacturing processes and the integration of renewable energy sources in largescale manufacturing establishments.
  
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, the manufacturing sector could achieve long-term carbon neutrality through new manufacturing processes supported by clean energy sources, a circular economy which increases materials efficiency and widespread carbon capture storage (CCS) utilisation.
  
        In this scenario, the manufacturing sector is forced to significantly increase production of key commodities to support the global transition whilst simultaneously reducing its carbon footprint. 
        
        This is likely to result in:
  
        - A sharp disruption to production (with asset damage).
  
        - Operating challenges with significant increases in costs.
  
        - Volatile commodity markets and a real uncertainty in demand.
  
        - High risk of stranded assets.
  
        Manufacturing industries that adopt a Delayed pathway to net zero emissions under the Delayed Transition scenario may significantly lose market value. It is expected that those industries could face stranded assets as uncertainty about climate policies and unanticipated breakthroughs in renewable technologies collide with substantial intertemporal and intersectoral investment adjustment costs. Carbon-intensive manufacturing activities such as petroleum and coal products manufacturing, chemical manufacturing and primary metal manufacturing are at particularly high risk. The result is stranded assets and legal claims.
        
        Due to the breadth and complexity of the manufacturing sector, manufacturing industries could need to adopt a range of different strategies based on specific circumstances of each industry and company in order to reduce the impact of this scenario. Some of these strategies include: 
        
        -	Mitigating the environmental impact of utilising high carbon footprint metals in potentially carbon-neutral manufacturing equipment and motors.
  
        - Integrating energy efficiency capital and processes into existing manufacturing processes in a way that considers whole-life carbon (to avoid capital-expensive rebuilds).
  
        - Revising business models to consider global supply chain emissions, particularly from raw material extraction and transportation.
  
        - Reduce demand for high-temperature processes.
  
        - Support the transition of large technical systems through long-term investment cycles.

        In Orderly transition scenarios, manufacturers could benefit from new revenue streams, but face rising operating costs due to carbon pricing policies and falling asset values as current infrastructure becomes increasingly obsolete.

        The following examples illustrate how the manufacturing sector could be impacted in an Orderly transition scenario:
  
        - **Increased costs:** this can occur from paying a price on carbon-intensive exports (see EU’s proposed Carbon Border Adjusted Mechanism) and rising energy costs.
  
        - **Reduced revenue:** this can occur due to decline in demand for consumer discretionary manufacturing products as abatement costs are likely passed onto the consumer.

          In Orderly Transition scenarios, CCS utilisation is projected to increase dramatically, with ~1800 megatons of CO<sub>2</sub> being stored annually by 2050 in the Below 2°C scenario, and ~4500 megatons in the Net Zero 2050 scenario which are significant increases from the respective 2030 values of ~150 megatons and ~ 350 megatons.

          business models towards low-carbon manufacturing processes and the
          integration of renewable energy sources in largescale manufacturing
          establishments.
        
        In Orderly scenarios, carbon pricing mechanisms will gradually increase which will force polluters in the manufacturing sector towards efforts to achieve long-term carbon neutrality, such as clean energy sources, a circular economy which increases materials efficiency and widespread CCS utilisation. A strong policy environment that supports manufacturers’ decarbonisation efforts could result in an immediate and smooth reduction of emissions. For example, in Orderly transition scenarios, CO2 emissions are expected to reduce between 76% and 94% by 2050 from 2020 levels based on CCS utilisation, fuel-switching, and improvements to resource and energy efficiency.
  
        Due to the breadth and complexity of the sector, manufacturing industries could need to adopt a range of different strategies based on specific circumstances of each industry and company to reduce the impact of this scenario. Some of these strategies include:
        
        - Mitigating the environmental impact of utilising high carbon footprint metals 
          in potentially carbon-neutral manufacturing equipment and motors.

        - Support the transition of large technical systems through long-term investment cycles.
        
        Additionally, critics suggest the effectiveness of carbon pricing schemes in facilitating abatement in the manufacturing sector is highly dependent upon whether the price of carbon adequately causes polluters to address the negative externalities they generate.

      exec_description: |
        The manufacturing sector is materially exposed to high physical risk impacts due to the projected increase in weather variation and the disruption this could cause to global supply chains.
      always: |
        At present, some manufacturing activities remain vulnerable to the physical impacts of climate change due to their reliance on raw materials and dependence on global supply chains, such that disruptions in one region can quickly result in world-wide shortages (In 2011, excessive flooding in Thailand resulted in a reduction in global industrial output by 2.5 percent and damages cost the world’s top three non-life insurance companies $5.3 billion in claims, which is greater than the cost of Japan’s earthquake and tsunami earlier the same year). For example, food manufactures, who rely on rice and wheat crops, already experience a reduction in the availability of raw materials as empirical analyses demonstrate a link between an annual decrease of 0.3-0.9% in rice and wheat yields as a result of climate-related weather effects.
        
        Without adequate adaptation strategies, continued exposure to changing weather conditions could significantly affect specific areas of manufacturing, affecting the profitability of these companies.
  
      high_materiality: |
        The following examples illustrate how the manufacturing sector could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:
  
        **Acute Impacts**
  
        - **Wildfires:** these could influence the regional availability of raw materials and influence volatility in commodity markets.
  
        - **Flooding events** these could damage facilities and equipment.
  
        **Chronic Impacts**
  
        - **Reductions in labour productivity:** Some industries can expect this as global mean temperatures rise.
  
        - **Drought:** this could result in competition amongst manufacturers for water resources which could affect production levels as industry accounts for approximately 40% of total water abstractions. It could also likely lead to an expectation of increased environmental regulation focusing on protecting water supply and quality. This could result in additional costs for water using industries.
  
        - **The expansion of tropical pests and diseases into temperate zones:** this could influence the regional availability of raw materials and increase the volatility of commodity markets. For example, it is thought a lack of genetic variation amongst rubber trees means rubber production is highly susceptible to disease which could significantly affect the availability of rubber on a global scale.
  
        - **Rising sea levels:** this could pose a risk to the manufacturing sector through damage to facilities and equipment, which is particularly apparent for the manufacturing hubs that are dominantly in Asia’s costal pathways.
  
        There are many actions manufacturing companies can take to adapt to the high physical risks mentioned above. This includes investing in more resilient physical infrastructure, significantly diversifying supplier portfolios, increasing the geographical competence of manufacturing operations and creating robust technical systems that can identify future physical stresses (particularly in the case of food manufacturing). By embedding such measures into long term climate business planning, manufacturing companies are better placed to absorb physical shocks in a high physical risk scenario.
  
        For example, where the availability of raw materials is declining, companies can look to integrate other materials into their manufacturing processes to reduce the supply-side risks associated with one material.
        
        Manufacturing companies in a high physical risk scenario could adopt one or more of the following supply-chain characteristics to maintain resilience against physical risks:
  
        - **Dependence:** a company could assess its dependence on a given supplier and seek to increase suppliers where possible and/or invest heavily critical suppliers to exercise more control over key decisions.
  
        - **Visibility:** a company could seek to fully understand the vulnerabilities, location, and operations and of its first and second tier suppliers and adopt strategies to reduce their risk accordingly such as increasing inventory stocks to mitigate acute stresses.
  
        - **Substitutability:** a company could assess the feasibility of replacing standard parts in its manufacturing process.
  
        - **Portability:** a company could make efforts to assess the ease at which physical machinery and other manufacturing operations can be moved when faced with disaster.
