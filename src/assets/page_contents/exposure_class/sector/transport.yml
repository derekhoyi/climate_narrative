    # Transport
    
    The **transport** sector refers to the movement of people and cargo, either as a service or 
    via consumer activity, as well as the construction, maintenance, and use of transportation 
    infrastructure. The transport sector includes subsectors for each mode 
    (Air, Rail, Water, Road), which is then further subdivided by freight or passenger, and 
    by vehicle type where relevant. In addition, there are support services for the transport 
    sector that are also included, such as logistics support for freight (e.g. Warehousing, 
    Storage, Packing, Crating). 
    
    Example companies in the transport sector would be airlines that carry passengers as 
    well as belly freight, trucking that delivers goods by road, or Urban Rail Metro services 
    that provide passenger transport. Whilst OEMs who manufacture transportation vehicles would 
    follow trends in industry, the demand for their vehicles depends on the longer-term expected 
    trends that transport activity undergoes.

        In the Delayed transition scenario, the transport sector is expected to undergo sudden 
        increases in operating costs from effective carbon prices, shifts in demand for transportation, 
        and the rapid replacement of older assets and fuels, leading to subsequent impacts both on 
        the profitability of the industry as a whole, and on shocks to profitability and activity 
        growth within the sector.
        
      always: |
        The transport sector will continue to play its role in facilitating global trade for the 
        coming years. The changing patterns in transportation mode, fuelling, and demand, led by 
        delayed policy action, leads to a correspondingly delayed and disruptive reduction in GHG 
        and particulate matter pollutant emissions towards 2050. 
        
        There is likely to be an impact on profitability for the sector. Firms may face unexpectedly 
        higher fuel costs, as the cost of fossil fuels (especially liquids) increases, and fuel 
        switching to more expensive alternative fuelling is required. Capital expenditure must also be 
        redirected as investment in infrastructure and replacement of vehicle fleets is required to 
        pivot firms to a low-carbon business model. Certain industries face strong changes in demand, 
        such as a modal shift from aviation to rail. The Delayed transition risk scenario also may 
        lead to limited relative reduction in GDP, which could result in changes in the demand for 
        passenger and transport goods on an economy-wide scale.
  
      high_materiality: |
          In the Delayed transition scenario, there are a number of potential impacts on the transport 
          sector. The sector is one exposed to significant policy constraints such as electrification or fuel 
          efficiency mandates, as well as significant susceptibility to consumer demand, such as a shift from 
          individual cars to public transit/walking/cycling, or a reduction in flights due to improvements in 
          high-speed rail and remote working.
        
          In the Delayed transition risk scenario, there is a sudden increase in the effective price of carbon 
          for transport demand, with the price growing tenfold in the span of just five years, from ~$10/tCO2e in 
          2030 up to ~$99/tCO2e in 2035, and ~$320/tCO2e in 2050.

          This represents a sudden shock from aggressive decarbonisation policies in the transportation sector, and is likely to 
          impact the sector in a multitude of ways, for example:
  
           -	**Increased operating costs:** the sudden rise in carbon and energy prices could potentially result in financial 
              impacts, as transport firms’ carbon emissions face a sharply rising price for legacy fuels in the form of a carbon 
              tax or cap & trade clearing price. Meanwhile, those who do commit to a fuel-switch, do so towards less established 
              and thus (initially) more expensive fuels, such as synthetic fuels and hydrogen. This is heightened by the relative 
              lack of ambition preventing a ramp-up of the low-carbon fuels and the price reductions scale and technological 
              maturity would bring
  
           -	**Increases in compliance requirements:** changes in regulations regarding vehicle emissions, fuel efficiency 
              standards, or electrification mandates, could lead to increases in compliance requirements and regulatory burden. 
              Firms may be forced to replace their fleets earlier than anticipated, adapt their operating procedures, or if they 
              are an OEM, reconfigure their manufacture to produce compliant vehicles
  
           -	**Readjusted capital expenditures:** new investments could be required to modify or replace current transport 
              infrastructure to pivot business models towards a low-carbon economy and integrate renewable energy into transport 
              networks. The lack of groundwork investment in earlier years could cause a bottleneck for investment and increase 
              the costs as risks are less well understood
  
           -	**Asset valuation could be repriced:** this could be based on the adjusted expectations with respect to decarbonisation, 
              leading to some level of stranding with older vehicles, or impairment on the asset value. The sudden policy shift is 
              especially likely to strand older vehicles sooner than expected
  
           -	**Consumer preferences may change:** both as a function of improved awareness of environmental impact, or as a function 
              of local policy decisions and modal shifts in transportation demand. For example, regional air travel is likely to compete 
              with high-speed and night rail, for distances below ~1000km, which is a function of both the pricing or convenience of rail 
              over aviation, as well as improved environmental conscientiousness, given the carbon intensity of air travel is over 
              10 times that of rail travel (according to figures published by the European Environment Agency). More climate-conscious 
              consumers may experience ‘flight shame’, decreasing demand for airlines, whilst increasing demand for lower carbon alternatives 
              such as (high speed) rail, provided rail operators have the infrastructure in place to serve the same destinations. Additionally, 
              advancements in remote working, telecommuting and teleconferencing, made during the widespread quarantines and lockdowns 
              following the COVID-19 pandemic, have shifted and reduced the demand for business flights or employee commuting significantly. 
              Sudden aggressive policy could enforce these shifts in the mode of transportation
  
           -	**GDP shocks and effects on the economy:** this may occur from a sudden policy change. This may cause a reduction in passenger 
              and goods transportation demand due to the slowdown of wider economic activity that a sudden policy shift may cause, as industry 
              shifts to the new direction
          
          In the Delayed transition scenario, modal shifts lead to different patterns of transportation. In aviation, global vehicle-kilometres 
          flown undergoes a volatile future, with periods of growth until 2040, where a sharp decline of 24% in distance travelled occurs within 
          a short five-year timeframe. Overall, for vehicle-kilometres travelled, long-term growth is still expected with an additional 44% in 
          distance flown between 2025 and 2050. Whilst the volatility remains in the case of passengers flown, an overall picture of industry 
          growth, with the 2050 passenger-kilometres flown being ~54% higher than in 2025.

          Rail sees significant growth in distance travelled in the Delayed transition scenario, reaching ~86% growth in 2050 relative 
          to 2025. The delay creates more uncertainty and a lack of investment in the required infrastructure, causing a stymied growth
          in late 2030s to early 2040s. Passenger rail sees a rapid growth in passenger-distance traversed, with a 115% increase in demand 
          between 2025 and 2050, whilst freight sees a slower and similarly stymied growth, growing by ~75% between 2025 and 2050 in 
          tonne-kilometres traversed.

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, international shipping undergoes a rapid shock, with the decade of 2025-2035 seeing a 24% 
        increase in tonne-kilometres of freight shipped, before the increased policy ambition, and the shock it brings, leads to a 
        steep decline in shipping demand by 15% in the next decade of 2035-2045, and effectively no recovery after that.

        Whilst transport demand for vehicles on the road grows, the total growth in vehicle-kilometres travelled is modest, 
        with only a 50% growth in distance traversed between 2025 and 2050. Passenger-distance traversed is especially 
        stymied, with a growth rate of just 35% between 2025 and 2050 in the delayed transition risk scenario. Road 
        freight has a much higher growth, as supply chains for lower-emissions freight (Rail and, on a per-kilometre 
        perspective, Shipping) are not sufficiently built out in the changing policy landscape. This leads to the freight 
        tonne-kilometres traversed by road growing by 75% between 2025 and 2050. The sudden policy shift also causes a 
        suppression of freight-distance traversed in the 2035-2040 timeframe, as policy increases the burden cost of road 
        freight, but the deployment of solutions has been delayed by a lack of foresight.

        With costly policies and insufficient planning reducing the demand for driving, short-distance journeys are 
        increasingly handled by cars instead of cycling and walking, with the 2035 people-kilometres traversed being 
        10% less than the 2025 distance traversed. The delays in decarbonisation policy reduce the urban planning 
        required to induce demand to people-powered transport, and artificially lowers the apparent cost of 
        car-centric urban planning and car transport, as externalities are not accounted for and instead paid by 
        wider society. Overall, the delayed transition scenario still leads to a net growth in human-powered transit, 
        with a 57% increase in distance traversed by 2050 relative to 2025.

        The ability of the transport sector to transition is highly dependent on the OEM manufacturers and their supply 
        chains, as well as in the development of other infrastructure supporters. In aviation, this is exemplified by 
        the slower than required uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuels - Jet Fuels made from refining bioliquids or 
        Synthetic fuels. This requires coordination from a long value chain including:
         
         - Bio-Feedstock Suppliers to supply the biomass for fuels in competition with biomass power plants that 
          provide electricity and heat
  
         - Biorefineries, typically operated by the oil and gas industry, who must secure a steady supply of feedstock, 
          and convert it to biofuels. They must also be incentivised to tilt production towards Sustainable Aviation Fuels, 
          as opposed to supplying the larger and more established biodiesel market
  
         - Aircraft OEM manufacturers who must produce aircraft that are technically capable of using Sustainable Aviation 
          Fuels at higher blends
  
         - Air Traffic and Safety Regulators, who must certify Sustainable Aviation Fuel blends, and otherwise classify 
          their operational properties, across international borders
  
         - Airports, who must guarantee the supply of sustainable aviation fuels for airlines to utilise in refuelling
  
         - Airlines, who must switch their fleet, secure offtakes of sustainable aviation fuels, and ensure their 
          availability on the routes they fly
  
         - International Civil Aviation Organisation, who must certify the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels within the 
          context of compliance with CORSIA
  
         - Investors, who must support the expenditures for transition across all these activities, whilst the aviation industry 
          suffers from the costs incurred due the COVID-19 pandemic, low profit margins across the industry, reduction in 
          demand from consumer trends and competition with High-Speed Rail, increased costs of operations due to fuel duties, 
          inclusion in carbon producing schemes such as the EU ETS, among other risks
        
        Whilst other sectors have had significant deployment and successes so far. In particular, the electrification of road 
        transport is an example where there has been significant uptick in electric vehicle demand, and charger access. According 
        to the IEA Global EV Outlook 2024, 1 in 5 new car sales were electric vehicles across the globe in 2023, compared to just 
        1 in 50 cars in 2018. This has primarily been driven by China, Europe, and the US, where EVs made up 1 in every 3, 5, and 10 
        cars sold in each region respectively.
        
        However, there is a significant concentration in the Electric Vehicles market, with a strong dependence on a few models 
        by each OEM, and the noticeable exclusion of certain vehicle types (such as smaller electric cars within the European and 
        US market) and certain OEMs (such as certain luxury car manufacturers). The supply chain is heavily dependent on certain 
        geographies, with a concentration of critical battery minerals processing and battery manufacture in China. This raises 
        concerns with regards to geopolitical disruptions to global trade. Battery Minerals and electrification has also received 
        attention due to the public awareness of social and local environmental concerns with mining, and thus a potential cooling 
        of consumer appeal or exposure to upstream regulations, enforcement, and controversies. 
        
        In the Delayed transition scenario, the profitability of the transport sector could also depend on the relevant companies 
        which are agile in adapting to sudden policy changes and invest in innovation and new technology. For example:
         
         - Fuel Switching, especially to electricity. In Delayed transition scenarios, Final Energy demand in the form of 
          electricity grows massively, with 2050 demand at over 1000% of the demand in 2025, meanwhile oil demand for 
          transport is expected to drop to just 48% of its 2025 demand in 2050
        
        Whilst some transportation is able to be electrified, such as road and rail transport, and potentially very-short distance 
        shipping and aviation too, the harder-to-abate subsectors of transportation such as most aviation, shipping, and potentially 
        heavy-goods vehicle trucking are expected to be more dependent on alternatives such as biofuels, hydrogen (and its derivatives), 
        and synthetic fuels. In a Delayed transition risk scenario, the lack of early response reduces the ramp-up of these alternative 
        fuels, leaving electrification as the only route available to decarbonise much of transportation.
        
        Fuel Switching requires significant changes to the vehicle fleet, the charging/refuelling infrastructure, and the supply chain for 
        fuel, to ensure access to the new fuels used. For example, a road vehicle fleet operator would need to replace their cars 
        with electric vehicles, ensure charging access for the cars in depots and routes, and ensure an electricity supplier. 
        Meanwhile a cruise line operator would need update the fleet to operate a new low-carbon fuel (for example, operating 
        methanol-powered ships), ensure all ports and shipyards are equipped to handle and provide fuelling as desired, and pay 
        for the new fuel at any premium or discount it may have.

        -	Energy Efficiency may reduce the emissions intensity of travel, either by streamlining the vehicle, or intelligent and 
          efficient operations can help to optimise routes and thus minimise emissions. For example, smart-logistics software 
          could be used to reduce the total miles travelled for freight. In the Delayed transition scenario, these innovations 
          could contribute to an overall decrease in CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. These scenarios also present 
          opportunities for the transport sector. Proactively investing in the above innovations could lead to positive gains 
          in commercial reputation and therefore magnify demand and overall revenue as consumers could proactively seek out 
          businesses with an incorporated green strategy. In a delayed transition risk scenario, early action helps to insulate 
          against the shocks caused to the wider economy by the sudden onset of meaningful decarbonisation and position a business 
          to capture a larger part of the market share.

        In Orderly scenarios, the transport sector is expected to undergo increased operating costs from effective carbon 
        prices, shifts in demand for transportation, and the replacement of older assets and fuels, leading to subsequent impacts 
        both on the profitability of the industry as a whole, and on shifts in profitability and activity growth within the sector.
  
      always: |
        The transport sector will continue to play its role in facilitating global trade for the coming years. The changing 
        patterns in transportation mode, fuelling, and demand, led by immediate policy action, leads to an immediately 
        noticeable and smooth reduction in GHG and particulate matter pollutant emissions towards 2050. 
        
        There is likely to be an impact on profitability for the sector. Firms may face higher fuel costs, as the 
        cost of fossil fuels (especially liquids) increases, and fuel switching to more expensive alternative fuelling 
        is required. Capital expenditure must also be redirected as investment in infrastructure and replacement of 
        vehicle fleets is required to pivot firms to a low-carbon business model. Certain industries face strong 
        changes in demand, such as a modal shift from aviation to rail.

        In Orderly scenarios, there are a number of potential impacts on the transport sector. The sector is one 
        exposed to significant policy constraints such as electrification or fuel efficiency mandates, as well as 
        significant susceptibility to consumer demand, such as a shift from individual cars to public transit/
        walking/cycling, or a reduction in flights due to improvements in high-speed rail and remote working.
        
        In Orderly scenarios, this leads to an increase in the effective price of carbon for transport demand. 
        The effective carbon price is very sensitive to the nature of the scenario, with the lowest ambition 
        of the Orderly scenarios (Below 2&deg;c) having an effective cost of $32/t CO2e in 2030, increasing to 
        $135/t CO2e in 2050. Meanwhile the highest policy ambition scenario, Net Zero 2050, has an effective 
        cost of $183/tCO2e in 2030, increasing to $749/t CO2e in 2050.

        The impact of this effective cost on the profitability of the transportation sector shows up in a 
        multitude of ways, for example:
        
        -	**Increased operating costs:** the rise in carbon and energy prices could potentially result in 
          financial impacts, as transport firms’ carbon emissions face a rising price for legacy fuels in 
          the form a carbon tax or cap & trade clearing price. Meanwhile those who do commit to a fuel-switch, 
          do so towards less established and thus (initially) more expensive fuels, such as synthetic fuels 
          and hydrogen
  
        -	**Increased compliance requirements:** changes in regulations regarding vehicle emissions, 
          fuel efficiency standards, or electrification mandates, could lead to increases in compliance 
          requirements and regulatory burden. Firms may be forced to replace their fleets earlier than 
          anticipated, adapt their operating procedures, or if they are an OEM, reconfigure their 
          manufacture to produce compliant vehicles
  
        -	**Readjusted capital expenditures:** new investments could be required to modify or replace 
          current transport infrastructure to pivot business models towards a low-carbon economy and 
          integrate renewable energy into transport networks
  
        -	**Asset valuation could be repriced:** this is based on the adjusted expectations with respect 
          to decarbonisation, leading to some level of stranding with older vehicles, or impairment on 
          the asset value
  
        -	**Consumer preferences may change:** both as a function of improved awareness of environmental 
          impact, or as a function of local policy decisions and modal shifts in transportation demand. 
          For example, regional air travel is likely to compete with high-speed and night rail, for 
          distances below ~1000km, which is a function of both the pricing or convenience of rail over 
          aviation, as well as improved environmental conscientiousness, given the carbon intensity of 
          air travel is over 10 times that of rail travel (according to figures published by the European 
          Environment Agency). More climate-conscious consumers may experience ‘flight shame’, decreasing 
          demand for airlines, whilst increasing demand for lower carbon alternatives such as (high speed) 
          rail, provided rail operators have the infrastructure in place to serve the same destinations. 
          Additionally, advancements in remote working, telecommuting and teleconferencing, made during the 
          widespread quarantines and lockdowns following the COVID-19 pandemic, have shifted and reduced the 
          demand for business flights or employee commuting significantly.
        
        In Orderly scenarios, these modal shifts lead to different pattens of transportation. In 
        aviation, global vehicle-kilometres flown either decreases by between ~10 and ~25% between 2025 
        and 2050 or undergoes stymied growth of 20% between 2025 and 2050 in the lowest-ambition of the 
        Orderly scenarios. However, this trend is less aggressive in terms of the number of people serviced 
        by aviation, with passenger-kilometres flown either decreasing by ~15% between 2025 and 2050 (Low Demand) 
        or increasing by between 5% and 30% in the same period (Net Zero 2050 and Below 2&deg;c, respectively). 
        This represents efficiency gains in aircraft, such as improvements in passenger capacity, a shift towards 
        longer international routes, and improvements to the seats filled per flight.

        Rail sees significant steady growth in Orderly scenarios, with growth in vehicle kilometres travelled 
        reaching between 75% and 125% by 2050 compared to 2025. This growth is seen in passenger rail, with the 
        growth of modal shifting leading to massive growth rates in passenger-kilometres travelled, 
        between ~85% to ~150% between 2025 and 2050. Meanwhile freight travel by rail grows by between 
        approximately 75% to 120% in the same period.

        In Orderly scenarios, international shipping is either reduced in volumes traversed by 11%-13% 
        (Net Zero 2050 and Low Demand, respectively), or grows slowly by just 7% in 2050 relative to 2025. 
        This is due to a variety of factors. Shipping is especially hard-to-abate and thus has a strong 
        demand-response to decarbonisation mandates and policy, in absence of an effective lever of 
        decarbonisation within the industry in the near term. Additionally, almost half of all shipping 
        is to handle the transfer of fossil fuels. As fossil fuel use declines globally, the volumes 
        traded also decline. Whilst some replacement occurs with biofuels, synthetic fuels, ammonia, and 
        renewable energy components, this is not sufficient to bring up the volumes, especially given 
        the wider economy’s electrification and the efficiency gains such electrification brings.

        Whilst transport demand for vehicles on the road grows, the subsector’s total growth in 
        vehicle-kilometres travelled is somewhat stymied in Orderly scenarios, with modest growth 
        in vehicle-kilometres travelled of between approximately 18% to 44% depending on the scenario. 
        Whilst there is a decrease in vehicles travelled, this does not affect the total passenger-kilometres 
        travelled, where growth is very stable across Orderly scenarios, hovering between ~26% and ~33%. 
        Here the difference is driven by the move towards more efficient driving, such as through 
        bus services. However Light-Duty Vehicles are still the primary growth in these scenarios. 
        Road freight is also somewhat insensitive to the details of scenarios between the Orderly 
        scenarios cohort, growing by between 65% and 85% in tonne-kilometres travelled in the 
        2025 to 2050 period.

        Local transport by road is cannibalised in demand by the growth of Cycling and Walking, 
        representing changes that Orderly scenarios would lead in urban design that improves 
        the accessibility and safety of pedestrian transit. These grow by between 30% and 70% 
        in the different Orderly scenarios in the 2025-2050 period.

        The ability of the transport sector to transition is highly dependent on the OEM 
        manufacturers and their supply chains, as well as in the development of other infrastructure 
        supporters. In aviation, this is exemplified by the slower than required uptake of Sustainable 
        Aviation Fuels - Jet Fuels made from refining bioliquids or Synthetic fuels. This requires 
        coordination from a long value chain including:
         
         - Bio-Feedstock Suppliers to supply the biomass for fuels in competition with biomass power 
          plants that provide electricity and heat
  
         - Biorefineries, typically operated by the oil and gas industry, who must secure a steady 
          supply of feedstock, and convert it to biofuels. They must also be incentivised to tilt 
          production towards Sustainable Aviation Fuels, as opposed to supplying the larger and more 
          established biodiesel market
  
         - Aircraft OEM manufacturers who must produce aircraft that are technically capable of using 
          Sustainable Aviation Fuels at higher blends
  
         - Air Traffic and Safety Regulators, who must certify Sustainable Aviation Fuel blends, 
          and otherwise classify their operational properties, across international borders
  
         - Airports, who must guarantee the supply of sustainable aviation fuels for airlines 
          to utilise in refuelling
  
         - Airlines, who must switch their fleet, secure offtakes of sustainable aviation fuels, 
          and ensure their availability on the routes they fly
  
         - International Civil Aviation Organisation, who must certify the use of Sustainable 
          Aviation Fuels within the context of compliance with CORSIA
  
         - Investors, who must support the expenditures for transition across all these activities, 
          whilst the aviation industry suffers from the costs incurred due the COVID-19 pandemic, 
          low profit margins across the industry, reduction in demand from consumer trends and 
          competition with High-Speed Rail, increased costs of operations due to fuel duties, 
          inclusion in carbon producing schemes such as the EU ETS, among other risks
  
        Whilst other sectors have had significant deployment and successes so far. In particular, 
        the electrification of road transport is an example where there has been significant uptick 
        in electric vehicle demand, and charger access. According to the IEA Global EV Outlook 2024, 
        1 in 5 new car sales were electric vehicles across the globe in 2023, compared to just 1 in 50 
        cars in 2018. This has primarily been driven by China, Europe, and the US, where EVs made up 
        1 in every 3, 5, and 10 cars sold in each region respectively.
        
        However, there is a significant concentration in the Electric Vehicles market, with a strong 
        dependence on a few models by each OEM, and the noticeable exclusion of certain vehicle types 
        (such as smaller electric cars within the European and US market) and certain OEMs (such as 
        certain luxury car manufacturers). The supply chain is heavily dependent on certain geographies, 
        with concentration of critical battery minerals processing and battery manufacture in China. 
        This raises concerns with regards to geopolitical disruptions to global trade. Battery Minerals 
        and electrification has also received attention due to the public awareness of social and local 
        environmental concerns with mining, and thus a potential cooling of consumer appeal or exposure 
        to upstream regulations, enforcement, and controversies. 
        
        In Orderly scenarios, the profitability of the transport sector could also depend on the 
        relevant companies proactively investing in innovation and new technology. For example:
         
         - Fuel Switching, especially to electricity. In Orderly scenarios, Final Energy demand in the form of 
         electricity grows massively, with 2050 demand at between 700-900% of the demand in 2025, meanwhile oil 
         demand for transport is expected to drop to just 25-50% of its 2025 demand in 2050, depending on scenario 
         ambition
        
        Whilst some transportation is able to be electrified, such as road and rail transport, and 
        potentially very-short distance shipping and aviation too, the harder-to-abate subsectors of 
        transportation such as most aviation, shipping, and potentially heavy-goods vehicle trucking 
        are expected to be more dependent on alternatives such as biofuels, hydrogen (and it’s derivatives), 
        and synthetic fuels.
  
        Fuel Switching requires significant changes to the vehicle fleet, the charging/refuelling 
        infrastructure, and the supply chain for fuel, to ensure access to the new fuels used. 
        For example, a road vehicle fleet operator would need to replace their cars with electric 
        vehicles, ensure charging access for the cars in depots and routes, and ensure an electricity 
        supplier. Meanwhile a cruiseline operator would need update the fleet to operate a new 
        low-carbon fuel (for example, operating methanol-powered ships), ensure all ports and 
        shipyards are equipped to handle and provide fuelling as desired, and pay for the new fuel 
        at any premium or discount it may have.

        -	Energy Efficiency may reduce the emissions intensity of travel, either by streamlining 
          the vehicle, or making modifications that reduce fuel consumption or improve cargo and 
          passenger capacity. An example would be aeroplane OEMs improving the drag performance 
          of sold models, and airlines configuring them to increase the passengers able to fly 
          in a single flight
  
        -	Intelligent and efficient operations can help to optimise routes and thus minimise 
          emissions. For example, smart-logistics software could be used to reduce the total 
          miles travelled for freight
        
        In Orderly scenarios, these innovations could contribute to an overall decrease 
        in CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. These scenarios also present opportunities 
        for the transport sector. Proactively investing in the above innovations could lead to 
        positive gains in commercial reputation and therefore magnify demand and overall 
        revenue as consumers could proactively seek out businesses with an incorporated 
        green strategy.

        The transportation sector, and the global supply chains that it underpins, are exposed 
        to physical risks from climate disasters and extreme weather events, both directly from 
        damages, and from the knock-on effects of a wider economic slowdown.
  
      always: |
        In a High physical risk (Hot House World) scenario, the transportation sector is exposed 
        to significant physical risks. The sector is necessarily geographically spread, exposed 
        to the elements, and dependent on infrastructure that is often outside the operational 
        or decision-making control of the firms and individuals that rely on them. Labour forces 
        and physical infrastructure are spread across extensive geographies, and global supply 
        chains are vulnerable to shocks that cause delays, congestions, or otherwise significant 
        knock-on disruptions to the wider economy. 
        
        Chronic climate effects such as raising sea-levels, increased precipitation, and increased 
        average temperatures, erode at the efficacy of vehicles, the labourers who operate those 
        vehicles, and stress the infrastructure that those vehicles rely on. 
        
        Acute climate disasters such as storms, wildfires, heatwaves, and flooding, can cause 
        significant destruction to physical transportation infrastructure, and disrupt operations 
        from route closures, rerouting. Acute disasters can also cause significant risks to 
        labourers who operate in remote regions transiting between destinations that would be 
        better equipped to resist changes, increasing the risk of harm or loss of life. Whilst 
        the transportation has significant prior experience with monitoring and operating in 
        changing weather conditions, the increased severity, frequency, and unprecedented 
        nature of the changing climate could lead to significant disruption and impacts on 
        profitability.
  
      high_materiality: |
          High physical risk (Hot House World) scenarios are expected to lead to significant 
          physical climate risk exposures to transportation in a variety of manners. The variety 
          of risks are due to a number of factors unique to the transportation sector, namely that:
       
       -	The transportation sector has very different modalities, which are exposed to 
          different climate and weather impacts. The shocks to air travel are significantly 
          different to those for maritime vessels, which differs from those of urban and 
          rural road and rail transport. Additionally, there are different aspects of 
          the industry affected differently. Transportation-as-a-Service, and port & 
          infrastructure operators, face significantly different risks to their 
          operation due to their business model
  
       -	Transportation is reliant on geographically diverse infrastructure both as 
          destinations (airports, shipyards, terminals, etc…) and as through-routes 
          (railways, roads, shipping lanes). This extends the area over which significant 
          climate effects can impact a route or destination, and this infrastructure is 
          often remote and thus not as likely to be subject to adaptation measures or 
          immediate disaster response
  
       -	Much of transportation is dependent on wider economic activity. Climate 
          stressors and disasters can subdue global economic activity. In freight, a 
          relative reduction in consumption induced by recessions would cause a relative 
          reduction in transit demand, affecting the profitability of those in freight logistics. 
          Meanwhile economic downturns also shift consumer demand for discretionary travel, reducing 
          passenger-kilometres travelled relative to the climate-agnostic baseline, especially for 
          long-distance trips that disproportionately affect air traffic and long-distance rail
      
          The following examples illustrate how the transport sector could be impacted in a High 
          physical risk (Hot House World) scenario:
    
        **Chronic Impacts**
         
         - **Higher average temperatures:** can affect vehicle and vehicle operator 
          performance. For example, aircraft may have to decrease take-off weight, lowering 
          passenger and cargo loads, due to the stress on runway tarmac, and rail may have 
          to operate at reduced speeds due to risks of buckling rails in higher temperatures. 
          Higher temperatures also may reduce worker productivity, as vehicle operators 
          are exposed in the transportation sector with little respite. Higher temperatures 
          may also affect the desirability for certain destinations, such as ski resorts, and 
          thus the passenger transit demand
  
         - **Rising sea levels:** risk significant amounts of coastal infrastructure, 
          requiring expensive relocations as coastal intrusion occurs. For leisure and tourism, 
          certain destinations may lose viability or attractiveness, causing decreased demand for 
          passenger transport
        
        **Acute Impacts**
        
         - **Extreme weather events such as flooding, wildfires, and storms:** these are likely to 
          cause significant disruption and damages to infrastructure, vehicles, cargo, and staff. 
          Being spread across a wide geographical area makes these impacts more likely and being 
          often in remote or unpopulated regions reduces the likelihood of adaptation measures being 
          taken to defend routes. Routes are also often outside the operational control or 
          decision-making remit of the transportation firm, and thus cannot be actively protected 
          or avoided. Their remote nature also means that responses to disasters are likely to 
          be delayed, and deprioritised in the case of climate disasters, in favour of more densely 
          populated regions. This risks significant delays from rerouting, or route closure, as well 
          as potentially causing significant direct damages
  
         - **Extreme weather events risk damages and loss of life:** this in particular to vehicles 
          and staff respectively, due to the exposed nature of vehicles, and the increased frequency 
          and severity of acute climate risks
  
         - **Extreme weather events cause significant unexpected disruption to the economy:** 
          reducing demand for freight and passenger transit
      
          The resilience and adaptation measures companies can take against the physical risks mentioned above 
          differ across different firms. For example, firms that maintain or otherwise depend on certain 
          infrastructure can invest in physical defences such as firebreaks, drainage ditches, levees, 
          and sea-walls to protect against the physical risks they are exposed to. Operators can invest 
          in weather monitoring and hazard tracking to pre-empt against disruptions, and thus make 
          supply lines more secure, and planning for the cash flow disruptions expected.

      exec_description: |
        In the High physical and transition risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario, the transport sector is highly exposed 
        to physical risks from the projected increased in weather disruption and stressors, as 
        well as to the sudden increase in operating costs induced by sudden and uncoordinated 
        decarbonisation policy, with significant potential impact on the profitability and 
        activity of the transportation sector.
  
      always: |
        The transport sector will continue to play its role in facilitating global trade for the 
        coming years. The changing patterns in transportation mode, fuelling, and demand, are 
        delayed by delayed, fractured, and uncoordinated policy action, leading to an 
        insufficient impact in reducing in GHG and particulate matter pollutant emissions 
        towards 2050.
        
        There is likely to be an impact on profitability for the sector. Firms may face 
        unexpectedly higher fuel costs, as the cost of fossil fuels (especially liquids) increases, 
        and fuel switching to more expensive alternative fuelling is required. Capital expenditure 
        must also be redirected as investment in infrastructure and replacement of vehicle fleets 
        is required to pivot firms to a low-carbon business model. Certain industries face strong 
        changes in demand, such as a modal shift from aviation to rail. The High physical and 
        transition risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario also may lead to a relative reduction in 
        GDP, which could result in changes in the demand for passenger and transport goods on an 
        economy-wide scale.
        
        The transportation sector is also exposed to significant physical risks. The sector 
        is necessarily geographically spread, exposed to the elements, and dependent on 
        infrastructure that is often outside the operational or decision-making control of 
        the firms and individuals that rely on them. Labour forces and physical infrastructure 
        are spread across extensive geographies, and global supply chains are vulnerable to 
        shocks that cause delays, congestions, or otherwise significant knock-on disruptions to 
        the wider economy. 
        
        Chronic climate effects such as raising sea-levels, increased precipitation, and 
        increased average temperatures, erode at the efficacy of vehicles, the labourers who 
        operate those vehicles, and stress the infrastructure that those vehicles rely on.
        
        Acute climate disasters such as storms, wildfires, heatwaves, and flooding, can 
        cause significant destruction to physical transportation infrastructure, and disrupt 
        operations from route closures, rerouting. Acute disasters can also cause significant 
        risks to labourers who operate in remote regions transiting between destinations that 
        would be better equipped to resist changes, increasing the risk of harm or loss of 
        life. Whilst the transportation has significant prior experience with monitoring 
        and operating in changing weather conditions, the increased severity, frequency, 
        and unprecedented nature of the changing climate could lead to significant disruption 
        and impacts on profitability.
  
      high_materiality: |
        In a High physical and transition risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario, there are a 
        number of potential impacts from physical and transition risks to the sector.
        
        Regarding transition risk, the transportation sector is one exposed to significant 
        policy constraints such as electrification or fuel efficiency mandates, as well 
        as significant susceptibility to consumer demand, such as a shift from individual 
        cars to public transit/walking/cycling, or a reduction in flights due to improvements 
        in high-speed rail and remote working. Delays and uncoordinated decarbonisation 
        policy risks making transition technologies and thus the cost of compliance with 
        these strategies more burdensome, and the solutions available less viable due 
        to a lack of forethought and investment in the infrastructure required for climate 
        solutions, such as EV chargers, or expansion of railways, thus stymying the 
        decarbonisation of the sector.
        
        In High physical and transition risk (Too-little-too-late) scenarios, the 
        increase in the effective price of carbon for transport demand, globally, 
        is relatively small, with the price growing steadily between ~$11/t CO2e in 
        2025, to ~$58/t CO2e in 2050. Whilst this appears globally as a steady 
        increase, the fractured nature of the scenario means that within individual 
        jurisdictions, the changes may be more or less severe depending on their ambition, 
        with sudden increases as political willpower suddenly shifts within individual 
        countries, but without the cross-jurisdictional collaboration and foreplanning 
        that can send the market signals to firms.

        Whilst these decarbonisation policies are jurisdictionally disparate, 
        the nature of much of the transport sector means that they will be exposed 
        to multiple jurisdictions and thus will have to follow the strongest of the 
        decarbonisation policies they may encounter. The impact of decarbonisation 
        impacts on the transportation sector are likely to include:
        
        -	**Increased operating costs:** the sudden rise in carbon and energy prices 
          could potentially result in financial impacts, as transport firms’ carbon 
          emissions face a sharply rising price for legacy fuels in the form of a 
          carbon tax or cap & trade clearing price. Meanwhile those who do commit 
          to a fuel-switch, do so towards less established and thus (initially) more 
          expensive fuels, such as synthetic fuels and hydrogen. This is heightened 
          by the relative lack of ambition preventing a ramp-up of the low-carbon 
          fuels and the price reductions scale and technological maturity would bring.
  
        -	**Increases in compliance requirements:** changes in regulations regarding 
          vehicle emissions, fuel efficiency standards, or electrification mandates, 
          could lead to increases in compliance requirements and regulatory burden. 
          Firms may be forced to replace their fleets earlier than anticipated, adapt 
          their operating procedures, or if they are an OEM, reconfigure their manufacture 
          to produce compliant vehicles.
  
        -	**Readjusted capital expenditures:** new investments could be required to 
          modify or replace current transport infrastructure to pivot business models 
          towards a low-carbon economy and integrate renewable energy into transport 
          networks. The lack of groundwork investment in earlier years could cause a 
          bottleneck for investment and increase the costs as risks are less well understood.
  
        -	**Asset valuation could be repriced:** this could be based on the adjusted 
          expectations with respect to decarbonisation, leading to some level of stranding 
          with older vehicles, or impairment on the asset value. The sudden policy shift is 
          especially likely to strand older vehicles sooner than expected.
  
        -	**Consumer preferences may change:** both as a function of improved awareness 
          of environmental impact, or as a function of local policy decisions and modal 
          shifts in transportation demand. For example, regional air travel is likely to 
          compete with high-speed and night rail, for distances below ~1000km, which is 
          a function of both the pricing or convenience of rail over aviation, as well as 
          improved environmental conscientiousness, given the carbon intensity of air travel 
          is over 10 times that of rail travel (according to figures published by the European 
          Environment Agency). More climate-conscious consumers may experience ‘flight shame’, 
          decreasing demand for airlines, whilst increasing demand for lower carbon alternatives 
          such as (high speed) rail, provided rail operators have the infrastructure in place to 
          serve the same destinations. Additionally, advancements in remote working, telecommuting 
          and teleconferencing, made during the widespread quarantines and lockdowns following 
          the COVID-19 pandemic, have shifted and reduced the demand for business flights or 
          employee commuting significantly. Sudden aggressive policy could enforce these 
          shifts in the mode of transportation.
  
        -	**GDP shocks and effects on the economy:** this may occur from a sudden policy change. 
          This may cause a reduction in passenger and goods transportation demand due to the 
          slowdown of wider economic activity a sudden policy shift may cause, as industry 
          shifts to the new direction.
       
       Whilst less significant than other transition risk scenarios, the High physical and 
       transition risk scenarios do cause modal shifts and thus different patterns of 
       transportation. In aviation, global vehicle-kilometres flown undergoes a volatile 
       future, with periods of growth and then decline. In the five-year period between 
       2040 and 2045, there is an over 18% reduction in vehicle-kilometres flown by planes. 
       Overall, the lack of policy ambition does still lead to growth, though disparate 
       decarbonisation does increase the costs and thus subdue this growth. With 2050 
       vehicle-kilometres flown being ~84% higher than in 2025, compared to a BAU scenario where 
       growth is 108% in the same period. Passenger aviation is similarly affected, with the 
       same volatility shock declining demand between 2040 and 2045 by ~12% in terms of 
       passenger-kilometres flown.

       Rail sees some growth in the High physical and transition risk (Too-little-too-late) 
       scenario, albeit with delays induced by the uncertain policy environment and thus 
       reduced investment in capacity-building relative to other transition scenarios. Over 
       the long-term, the industry still grows, by approximately 92% in 2050 relative to 
       2025 for vehicle-kilometres travelled, around 120% for passenger-kilometres travelled, 
       and approximately 84% for freight tonne-kilometres in the same period.

       Without significant coordination on decarbonisation, shipping is relatively restrained. 
       Shipping is a hard-to-abate sector, so weaker carbon policies have a significant impact 
       on the volumes of shipped goods. The lack of coordinated decarbonisation means that 
       significant volumes of fossil fuels, which currently make up approximately half of 
       all shipping, continues to be shipped into the mid-century, and the lack of coordination 
       makes policy specific to international shipping more difficult to enforce. As such, 
       the demand grows at a rate like transition-agnostic scenarios. The 2050 volume shipped 
       in tonne-kilometres is however only 21% greater than that of 2025, induced by the global 
       downturn that occurs in this high physical and transition risk scenario.

       Transport demand for vehicles on the road grows, with only minor reductions compared 
       to a transition-agnostic scenario. Whilst road transport is the quickest to respond to 
       decarbonisation policies that do get implemented, and the most effectively in control 
       of jurisdictions to enforce, there are significant available decarbonisation policies 
       available for road that maintain the modal transit (such as electrification). These 
       are subdued in effectiveness by a lack of clear market signals to produce the necessary 
       infrastructure. 
       
       Total vehicle-kilometres travelled grows by approximately 54% in 2050 relative to 
       2025, whilst passenger-kilometres traversed is more subdued, growing by ~39% in the 
       same period. Road freight grows significantly as the often only available land 
       logistics option when rail is not sufficiently built out, and thus grows by 
       approximately 77% in the 2025 to 2050 timeframe.

       The lack of clear transition signals, and policies relating to infrastructure, reduces 
       the modal shift to people-powered transit, as urban centres are not made more 
       walkable and transition-friendly, and the cost of road-transport is kept artificially 
       cheap by not having any policy to tackle the externalities faced. Long-term however, 
       growth in people-powered transit is enabled, as costs and a lack of emissions-compliant 
       alternatives force the modal shift. Between 2025 and 2050, passenger-kilometres 
       travelled by cycling and walking grow by almost 60%.

       The ability of the transport sector to transition is highly dependent on the OEMs 
       manufacturers and their supply chains, as well as in the development of other infrastructure 
       supporters. In aviation, this is exemplified by the slower than required uptake 
       of Sustainable Aviation Fuels - Jet Fuels made from refining bioliquids or Synthetic 
       fuels. This requires coordination from a long value chain including:
        
        -	Bio-Feedstock Suppliers to supply the biomass for fuels in competition with biomass power 
          plants that provide electricity and heat
  
        -	Biorefineries, typically operated by the oil and gas industry, who must secure a steady 
          supply of feedstock, and convert it to biofuels. They must also be incentivised to tilt 
          production towards Sustainable Aviation Fuels, as opposed to supplying the larger and 
          more established biodiesel market
  
        -	Aircraft OEM manufacturers who must produce aircraft that are technically capable of 
          using Sustainable Aviation Fuels at higher blends
  
        -	Air Traffic and Safety Regulators, who must certify Sustainable Aviation Fuel blends, 
          and otherwise classify their operational properties, across international borders
  
        -	Airports, who must guarantee the supply of sustainable aviation fuels for airlines 
          to utilise in refuelling
  
        -	Airlines, who must switch their fleet, secure offtakes of sustainable aviation fuels, 
          and ensure their availability on the routes they fly
  
        -	International Civil Aviation Organisation, who must certify the use of Sustainable 
          Aviation Fuels within the context of compliance with CORSIA
  
        -	Investors, who must support the expenditures for transition across all these 
          activities, whilst the aviation industry suffers from the costs incurred due the 
          COVID-19 pandemic, low profit margins across the industry, reduction in demand 
          from consumer trends and competition with High-Speed Rail, increased costs of 
          operations due to fuel duties, inclusion in carbon producing schemes such as the 
          EU ETS, among other risks
       
       In a high physical and transition risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario, the 
       decarbonisation policy is delayed, partisan, and uncoordinated. This makes the 
       coordination between different aspects of the supply chain much more difficult, 
       and market signals are confused and diluted across jurisdictions, making investment 
       in decarbonisation far harder to achieve. This is especially true in aviation and shipping, 
       where the vast majority of activity is international and thus requires complex 
       coordination across jurisdictions and actors within and around the industry.
       
       Whilst other sectors have had significant deployment and successes so far. In 
       particular, the electrification of road transport is an example where there has 
       been significant uptick in electric vehicle demand, and charger access. According 
       to the IEA Global EV Outlook 2024, 1 in 5 new car sales were electric vehicles 
       across the globe in 2023, compared to just 1 in 50 cars in 2018. This has primarily 
       been driven by China, Europe, and the US, where EVs made up 1 in every 3, 5, 
       and 10 cars sold in each region respectively.
       
       However, there is a significant concentration in the Electric Vehicles market, 
       with a strong dependence on a few models by each OEM, and the noticeable exclusion 
       of certain vehicle types (such as smaller electric cars within the European and 
       US market) and certain OEMs (such as certain luxury car manufacturers). The supply 
       chain is heavily dependent on certain geographies, with concentration of critical 
       battery minerals processing and battery manufacture in China. This raises concerns 
       with regards to geopolitical disruptions to global trade. Battery Minerals and 
       electrification has also received attention due to the public awareness of social 
       and local environmental concerns with mining, and thus a potential cooling of 
       consumer appeal or exposure to upstream regulations, enforcement, and controversies. 
       These supply chain and OEM concerns are exacerbated by the additional stressors of 
       physical risks (described below) in a High physical and transition risk scenario.
       
       In addition, the profitability of the transport sector could also depend on the relevant 
       companies proactively investing in innovation and new technology. For example:
       
       -Fuel Switching, especially to electricity. In High physical and transition risk 
        scenarios, Final Energy demand in the form of electricity grows massively, with 
        2050 demand at almost 970% of the demand in 2025, meanwhile oil demand for transport 
        is expected to drop to just 57% of its 2025 demand in 2050, albeit this delay is limited, 
        with an initial short-term increase in oil demand.
  
       Whilst some transportation is able to be electrified, such as road and rail 
       transport, and potentially very-short distance shipping and aviation too, 
       the harder-to-abate subsectors of transportation such as most aviation, shipping, 
       and potentially heavy-goods vehicle trucking are expected to be more dependent on 
       alternatives such as biofuels, hydrogen (and it’s derivatives), and synthetic fuels. 
       In a high physical and transition risk (too-little-too-late) scenario, the lack 
       of early or coordinated response reduces the ramp-up of these alternative fuels, 
       leaving electrification as the only route available to decarbonise much of 
       transportation, and lacking for certain modes of transportation.
  
       Fuel Switching requires significant changes to the vehicle fleet, the 
       charging/refuelling infrastructure, and the supply chain for fuel, to 
       ensure access to the new fuels used. For example, a road vehicle fleet 
       operator would need to replace their cars with electric vehicles, ensure 
       charging access for the cars in depots and routes, and ensure an electricity 
       supplier. Meanwhile a cruise line operator would need update the fleet to 
       operate a new low-carbon fuel (for example, operating methanol-powered ships), 
       ensure all ports and shipyards are equipped to handle and provide fuelling as 
       desired and pay for the new fuel at any premium or discount it may have.

       -	Energy Efficiency may reduce the emissions intensity of travel, either 
          by streamlining the vehicle, or making modifications that reduce fuel 
          consumption or improve cargo and passenger capacity. An example would 
          be aeroplaneeIntelligent and efficient operations can help to optimise 
          routes and thus minimise emissions. For example, smart-logistics software 
          could be used to reduce the total miles travelled for freight.eIn High 
          physical and transition risk scenarios, these innovations could contribute 
          to an overall decrease in CO2 emissions in the transportation sector, 
          albeit the speed and scale of their deployment comes too late for 
          Paris-aligned decarbonisation.
       
       A High physical and transition risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario would be 
       expected to lead to significant physical climate risk exposures to 
       transportation in a variety of manners. The variety of risks are due to a 
       number of factors unique to the transportation sector, namely that:
      
       -	The transportation sector has very different modalities, which are exposed 
          to different climate and weather impacts. The shocks to air travel are 
          significantly different to those for maritime vessels, which differs from 
          those of urban and rural road and rail transport. Additionally, there are 
          different aspects of the industry affected differently. Transportation-as-a-Service, 
          and port & infrastructure operators, face significantly different risks to 
          their operation due to their business models
  
       -	Transportation is reliant on geographically diverse infrastructure both as 
          destinations (airports, shipyards, terminals, etc…) and as through-routes 
          (railways, roads, shipping lanes). This extends the area over which 
          significant climate effects can impact a route or destination, and this 
          infrastructure is often remote and thus not as likely to be subject to 
          adaptation measures or immediate disaster response
  
       -	Much of transportation is dependent on wider economic activity. Climate 
          stressors and disasters can subdue global economic activity. In freight, 
          a relative reduction in consumption induced by recessions would cause a 
          relative reduction in transit demand, affecting the profitability of those 
          in freight logistics. Meanwhile economic downturns also shift consumer 
          demand for discretionary travel, reducing passenger-kilometres travelled 
          relative to the climate-agnostic baseline, especially for long-distance 
          trips that disproportionately affect air traffic and long-distance rail.
       
       The following examples illustrate how the transport sector could be impacted 
       in a High physical and transition risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario:
       
       **Chronic Impacts**
       
       -	**Higher average temperatures:** this can affect vehicle and vehicle 
          operator performance. For example, aircraft may have to decrease 
          take-off weight, lowering passenger and cargo loads, due to the 
          stress on runway tarmac, and rail may have to operate at reduced 
          speeds due to risks of buckling rails in higher temperatures. 
          Higher temperatures also may reduce worker productivity, as 
          vehicle operators are exposed in the transportation sector with 
          little respite. Higher temperatures may also affect the 
          desirability for certain destinations, such as ski resorts, 
          and thus the passenger transit demand.
  
       -	**Rising sea levels:** this risk significant amounts of coastal 
          infrastructure, requiring expensive relocations as coastal intrusion 
          occurs. For leisure and tourism, certain destinations may lose 
          viability or attractiveness, causing decreased demand for 
          passenger transport. 
       
       **Acute Impacts**
       
       -	**Extreme weather events such as flooding, wildfires, and storms:** 
          these are likely to cause significant disruption and damages to 
          infrastructure, vehicles, cargo, and staff. Being spread across a 
          wide geographical area makes these impacts more likely and being 
          often in remote or unpopulated regions reduces the likelihood of 
          adaptation measures being taken to defend routes. Routes are also 
          often outside the operational control or decision-making remit of 
          the transportation firm and thus cannot be actively protected or 
          avoided. Their remote nature also means that responses to 
          disasters are likely to be delayed, and deprioritised in the 
          case of climate disasters, in favour of more densely populated 
          regions. This risks significant delays from rerouting, or route 
          closure, as well as potentially causing significant direct damages.
          
       -	**Extreme weather events risk damages and loss of life:** namely 
          to vehicles and staff respectively, due to the exposed nature of 
          vehicles, and the increased frequency and severity of acute 
          climate risks.
  
       -	**Extreme weather events cause significant unexpected disruption 
          to the economy:** reducing demand for freight and passenger transit.
       
       The resilience and adaptation measures companies can take against the 
       physical risks mentioned above differ across different firms. 
       For example, firms that maintain or otherwise depend on certain 
       infrastructure can invest in physical defences such as firebreaks, 
       drainage ditches, levees, and sea-walls to protect against the 
       physical risks they are exposed to. Operators can invest in weather 
       monitoring and hazard tracking to pre-empt against disruptions, 
       and thus make supply lines more secure, and planning or the cash flow 
       disruptions expected.
