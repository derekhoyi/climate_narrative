    The **utilities** sector comprises companies that provide basic amenities
    such as water, sewage services, electricity, and gas. The sector includes
    companies that:
  
    - Produce or distribute electricity (Electric Utilities)
  
    - Distribute and transmit natural and manufactured gas (Gas Utilities)
  
    - Purchase and redistribute water to the end consumer (Water Utilities)
  
    - Have diversified activities in addition to core electric utility, gas
      utility or water utility operations  (Multi-Utilities)
  
    - Operate as Independent Power Producers (IPPs), Gas and Power Marketing and
      Trading Specialists and Integrated Energy Merchants
  
    - Generate and distribute electricity using renewable sources (Renewable
      Electricity Companies)
  
    Note that this sector excludes companies that are primarily involved in gas
    exploration or production; storage and/or transportation of fossil fuels and
    their derivatives; and manufacture of capital equipment used to generate
    electricity from renewable and non-renewable sources.

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, the utility sector may 
        benefit from increased revenue as the global energy system becomes more 
        electrified but faces a sharply rising carbon price post-2030 which could 
        increase production costs for carbon intensive utilities without adequate 
        transition plans.
  
      always: |
        The Delayed Transition scenario is primarily characterised by the 
        more disruptive effects on the utility sector. This can be seen most 
        clearly when comparing the Below 2&deg;C scenario and the Delayed Transition 
        scenario. The two scenarios converge on similar long-term climate cumulative 
        emissions and temperature objectives; but while policy action (for which an 
        effective carbon price is used as a proxy) consistent with those objectives 
        begins almost immediately in the Orderly Below 2&deg;C scenario, 
        it does not begin in earnest until 2030 in the Delayed Transition 
        scenario.
        
        This ultimately means that switching towards renewables and away from fossil 
        fuels is first slow and then more rapid, and that the negative effects of 
        carbon pricing on fossil fuel intensive utilities' revenues and margins take 
        a lot longer to emerge. There would be considerable dispersion of impacts 
        across firms in the Delayed transition scenarios, depending on the 
        carbon intensity of their production processes.
  
      high_materiality: |
        Changes in implicit carbon pricing, electricity demand, the energy mix, and energy 
        prices are likely to dominate financial impacts, through the same revenue 
        and cost channels. However, in the Delayed Tansition scenario, for a 
        given long-term emissions and temperature objective, effects will likely 
        be amplified, either because of policy divergences across sectors, or because 
        delayed decarbonisation requires greater decarbonisation later.

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, electricity-use increases by c.20% by 2030 and 
        more than doubles by 2050, from ~100 exajoules to ~200 exajoules.

        Comparing energy usage and mix patterns between the Below 2&deg;C and Delayed 
        Transition scenarios, we generally see similarly large shifts towards solar 
        and wind generation, and away from fossil fuel generation over the longer-term. 
        A key difference, however, is that under Delayed Transition, carbon prices 
        rise later, more quickly and to a higher level, to achieve the required rate 
        of decarbonisation. This has the potential to generate larger reductions in 
        total energy usage because rationing must do more of the work than more gradual 
        technological change. It also has the potential to be much more damaging for 
        the margins of more fossil fuel intensive utilities , due to the whiplash in 
        policy signals leading to investments that risk stranding.
        
        As with the Orderly scenarios, solar and wind become the dominant technologies 
        in a Delayed Transition scenario, with solar representing nearly 40% of electricity 
        generation capacity by 2030 and more than 90% by 2050; completely displacing coal 
        (before 2025) and gas (before 2025). These models also envision only a modest role 
        for carbon, capture and storage technologies to keep fossil fuel usage viable over 
        the longer term.

        Testing these assumptions using different models and narratives remains wise, 
        especially to allow for policy variation across different regions in the scenarios 
        that fall short of achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050.
        
        In a Delayed Transition scenario, the sudden changes in policy ambition has significant 
        risks to investment. A lack of early price signal may lead to lock-in investments 
        in carbon-intensive assets and firms, and as decarbonisation policy is suddenly 
        implemented, it may lead to a valuation shock and asset stranding/early retirement. 
        Similarly, low-carbon technologies are underinvested, especially for those that 
        require longer-term planning such as nuclear, hydropower, or biofuels. Individual 
        firms, especially those already invested in the transition, may have a valuation 
        uplift in a Delayed transition scenario.
        
        Companies considering how to transition, and investors looking to encourage or 
        otherwise position themselves within such transitions, also need to account for 
        the sector’s diversity. Different strategies will be appropriate for different 
        firms to maintain revenues and minimise the long-term financial impact. 
  
        Examples include:
  
        - Expanding renewable energy development, including self-generation assets;
        
        - Investing into grid infrastructure to improve storage, transmission, and distribution efficiency for heat and power;
        
        - Retrofitting existing thermal power generation for efficiency, co-generation, and fuel switching;
        
        - Where appropriate, investment in Carbon Capture, Transportation, and Storage to prolong the operating lifespan of existing fossil power plants;
        
        - Retiring low-efficient fossil power generation;
        
        - Supporting the development of low-carbon alternatives to fossil gas;
        
        - Increasing the weight of electricity in their portfolio.

        In Orderly transition scenarios, the utility sector may benefit 
        from the global energy system becoming more electrified but could 
        face rising carbon prices which could increase production costs for 
        carbon-intensive utilities without adequate transition plans.
  
      always: |
        The utilities sector would have a critical role to play in an orderly 
        transition to either Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050, or a 
        Below 2&deg;C scenario. Orderly transition scenarios have two key features: 
        the decarbonisation of the global power and hence utilities sector; and 
        the electrification of energy usage in as many other emitting sectors, 
        like transportation and parts of industry, as possible.
        
        The supporting pillars for the types of accelerated transitions envisaged 
        in the Orderly scenarios would involve radical changes in climate policy, 
        via significant increases in carbon prices, as well as much more stringent 
        regulatory ‘command and control’ policies. While opportunities exist for most 
        electric utility companies to perform well under these scenarios, thanks 
        largely to the demand creation from electrification, there would be considerable 
        dispersion of impacts across these firms, depending on the carbon intensity of 
        their production processes. The exception to this general rule of thumb for 
        Orderly Transition scenarios would be the Low Demand scenario, where weaker 
        electricity demand and rising implicit carbon costs could see profits fall 
        across the sector. Gas utilities could face significant transition risks, 
        with increased operating costs across all transition scenarios due to a switch 
        to less-established low-carbon fuel sources (biogas, hydrogen, synthetic gas 
        fuels). Whilst margins are eroded, gas utilities may also face decreased demand 
        due to electrification and efficiency improvements. Water utilities are indirectly 
        exposed to the volatility in electricity, used for desalination, purification, 
        wastewater treatment, and pumping. 
  
      high_materiality: |
        Changes in effective carbon pricing, electricity demand, the energy mix and energy prices 
        are likely to dominate financial impacts, with the extent dependant on how
        reliant the company's production/revenue mix is on low-carbon electricity
        and gas, the company's transition plans and how this compares to the sector
        average. 
        
        For example:
  
        - **Increased revenue**: this occurs for electric utilities in all transition scenarios 
          except Low Demand as the global energy system becomes more electrified, with revenue 
          gains strongest for firms with zero and low carbon-intensive production processes. 
          In Orderly transition scenarios, electricity uses increases by c.20% by 2030 and more 
          than doubles by 2050, from ~100 exajoules to ~220 exajoules, except in the Low Demand 
          scenario where demand remains lowest of any scenarios.

        [IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer. REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8.](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads)
  
        - **Reduced revenue**: this can occur for carbon-intensive utilities as consumers 
          switch to low carbon/electrified alternatives for heating and become more energy 
          autonomous.
  
        - **Increased operating costs**: this can occur for gas and electric utilities from 
          regulatory compliance costs or otherwise paying a price on carbon emissions via tax 
          or cap & trade clearing price, albeit with considerable dispersion in the ability to 
          pass carbon prices on to end-users depending on the carbon intensity of a firm’s 
          operations. 
  
        - **Readjusted capital expenditures**: this can occur for new investments required to 
          pivot business model towards renewable electricity generation. Water utilities could 
          be required to invest in becoming energy autonomous to combat volatility in energy 
          prices, for example using biogas Combined Heat and Power engines, which utilise the 
          biogas produced through the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge at water recycling 
          centres.
  
        Risks are heavily concentrated in carbon-intensive utilities that do not have adequate 
        transition plans, whilst opportunities exist for utilities drawing most heavily on zero 
        and low carbon activities. Capital investments into fossil intensive electricity would 
        significantly lag investment into renewable electricity and storage. In a Below 2&deg;C 
        scenario, reduced ambition leads to the expectation of lower levels of investment in 2030 
        than in a Net Zero 2050 scenario, demonstrating action needs to be significantly 
        accelerated to keep temperature rise to just above 1.5&deg;C relative to below 2&deg;C.

        Nevertheless, in Orderly Transition scenarios, the clear policy signals as shown by 
        the steadily increasing implicit carbon process, reduce the risks of sudden valuation 
        shocks, as transition is priced in early. This prevents both sudden rises in the 
        valuation of low-carbon assets and decarbonisation leaders, as well as the sudden 
        devaluation of carbon-intensive assets. Forward policy planning allows for firms 
        to better position against risks of sudden asset stranding, though individual 
        firms may struggle to keep pace, especially with more ambitious scenarios such 
        as Net Zero 2050.
        
        Focusing on electricity generation capacity, solar and wind see the 
        largest increases in Orderly Transition scenarios. In contrast the outlook for coal, 
        oil and natural gas is much poorer, though gas continues to have a significant 
        role in the short and medium term, especially in the Below 2&deg;C scenario.

        Users should be aware that the results presented are representative of a 
        particular energy-systems model (REMIND-MAgPIE), which makes particular 
        assumptions about how the relative costs of different technologies are 
        likely to evolve over the longer-term (in particular, REMIND-MAgPIE has 
        a “learn by doing” approach to future costs, as well as a perfect forecast 
        of future costs). The outcomes of this model is the result of an ensemble, 
        and even in Orderly transition scenarios, the zero and low carbon ‘winners’ 
        cannot be predicted with certainty. The relative cost reductions and growth 
        rates of solar and wind technologies, government nuclear investment plans, 
        and the viability of biomass, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage 
        technologies at greater scale are all highly uncertain.
        
        Integrated Assessment Models also also tend to place a low weight on the 
        role of nascent technologies. Because alternative assumptions about future 
        technology can generate vastly different usage patterns across the renewable 
        and fossil fuel types, users undertaking their own analyses should test the 
        sensitivity of their results to alternative models and assumptions.
        
        Again, the user, where possible, should consider how policies directed at the 
        utility sector are likely to vary across jurisdictions as these have the potential 
        to significantly alter the results for utilities and region/sector averages.
        
        Companies considering how to transition in ways consistent with Orderly Transition 
        scenario pathways, and investors looking to encourage such transitions, also need 
        to account for the sector’s diversity. Different strategies will be appropriate 
        for different firms to maintain revenues and minimise the long-term financial 
        impact.

        - Expanding renewable energy development, including self-generation assets;
        
        - Investing into grid infrastructure to improve storage, transmission, and distribution efficiency for heat and power;
        
        - Retrofitting existing thermal power generation for efficiency, co-generation, and fuel switching;
        
        - Where appropriate, investment in Carbon Capture, Transportation, and Storage to prolong the operating lifespan of existing fossil power plants;
        
        - Retiring low-efficient fossil power generation;
        
        - Supporting the development of low-carbon alternatives to fossil gas;
        
        - Increasing the weight of electricity in their portfolio.

      exec_description: |
        In high physical risk scenarios, extreme weather events could increase 
        disruption and cause damage to infrastructure, resulting in severe impacts 
        for the utilities sector as large proportion of the value of most utilities 
        is comprised of tangible (physical) capital.
  
      always: |
        High physical risk scenarios are those in which global policy makers do not 
        take sufficient steps to hold temperature increases below the Paris Agreement's 
        limit of +2&deg;C. These in turn can be decomposed into scenarios involving 
        either slow rates of policy change derived from countries' NDCs, or 
        Current Policy scenarios in which there is no new policy taken at all from 
        the present day.
        
        The physical effects of climate change on utilities can be decomposed into the 
        chronic climate events, such as raised sea-levels and acute changes in the 
        frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, 
        wildfires, cyclones and flooding. These effects will definitionally be larger 
        in high physical risk scenarios with significant disruptions to the utility sector. 
        As utility operations are vastly dependent on the availability of natural resources 
        and physical assets both localised (e.g. power plants) and distributed 
        (e.g. grid infrastructure), the effects on profitability and valuations through 
        this channel will be highly dependent for individual firms on the geography of 
        the underlying assets.
  
      high_materiality: |
        Utilities are exposed to the chronic and acute threats of physical climate change, 
        and this is exacerbated in a High Physical Risk (Hot house world) scenario. 
        Different utility activities are exposed for a variety of reasons.  
        The following (non-exhaustive) examples illustrate how the utilities sector 
        could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:
        
        **Chronic Impacts**
        
        - **Rising sea-levels**: this can cause existing power, heat, and water 
          infrastructure to be forced to migrate from low-lying coastal areas, 
          and saltwater intrusion threatens potable water reservoirs and resources 
          to those already stressed communities.
        
        - **Chronic water stress from changes in precipitation patterns and rising average temperatures**: 
          this would increase the cost and reduce the availability of water, with shortages in water 
          directly effecting water utilities’ ability to service communities, or the ability for hydropower 
          to generate electricity from reduced water resources, or otherwise stress thermal power generation 
          which relies on water for cooling and as the working fluid for power generation, reducing their 
          efficiency, safety, and potentially forcing shutdowns. Increasing average temperatures increase 
          the demand for water, adding to this water stress.
        
        - **Higher temperatures**: this may cause significant direct and indirect stresses 
          from reduced efficiencies for water, heat, and electric generation and distribution. 
          Increasing temperatures may lead to an increase in water resource fouling from algal 
          blooms, reduced efficiencies for thermal power plants or electricity distribution, 
          and increased variability in local weather (including “dunkelflaute” - periods of 
          low-wind and low-light conditions that reduce the effectiveness of wind and solar 
          power). As evidenced in the 2025 Global Energy Review, higher temperatures is a 
          major driver in increases in electricity demand for residential and commercial cooling, 
          and thus electricity demand is expected to grow faster than climate-agnostic business 
          demand would otherwise suggest.
        
        **Acute Impacts**
        
        - **Extreme weather events such as flooding, wildfires, and storms**: 
          this can cause direct damages or curtailment to utilities supply, transmission, 
          and distribution. Water resources can be contaminated, overhead powerlines or 
          substations damaged or destroyed, and powerplants made inoperable. The utilities 
          sector in particular is especially susceptible to these events given a lot of 
          generating infrastructure is located in areas exposed to increased flooding risk 
          as well as cyclone effects, and a large proportion of the value of most utilities 
          is comprised of tangible (physical) capital.
        
        There are many adaptation actions that companies can take to reduce the physical risks 
        mentioned above. These include, investing in resilient solutions e.g. underground power 
        line networks, disaster prevention systems (e.g. vegetation management to keep tree 
        limbs a safe distance from power lines) and increase contribution of electricity 
        businesses vs gas businesses. However, adaptation becomes more difficult and costly 
        as the extent of the temperature and climate change rises.
        
        The most serious, sustained impacts on asset prices are likely to manifest later 
        in the scenario horizon. Indeed, standard discounting methods generate relatively 
        moderate negative effects on utility security valuations, though there is naturally 
        significant variation depending on their locational characteristics.
        
        It is also important to keep in mind that because the high physical risk scenarios 
        are also scenarios in which there is only an extremely slow energy transition, the 
        transitional risk effects on valuations will generally reverse compared with the 
        Orderly and Disorderly Transition scenarios. For example, low-carbon-intensive utilities 
        could face valuation impairments compared to current market prices rather than uplifts,
        while high-carbon-intensive utilities may see uplifts instead of impairments. This is 
        because markets may price in an expected increase in ambition over current countries’ 
        NDCs, and particularly the maintenance of current policy.
        
        Despite this, solar and wind are still expected to become the dominant energy sources 
        globally with much of the existing growth momentum already baked into forecasts.

        Again though, there will be significant variation in these valuation effects across 
        regions as NDCs and current policy settings vary significantly across different jurisdictions.

        In too-little-too-late scenarios, a coordinated global drive to accelerate the 
        transition to renewables never comes, instead arriving in a fragmented and delayed 
        manner, leading to higher transition risk and extreme weather events that could 
        increase disruption, cause damage to infrastructure and ultimately result in severe 
        physical risk impacts for the utilities sector.
  
      always: |
        Changes in carbon prices, energy prices and energy mix are likely to dominate 
        transition risk impacts with policy changes likely to diverge across regions in a 
        Fragmented World scenario. Transitioning to a net zero economy would require a 
        significant investment flow for an extended period however this is clearly lacking 
        in the Too-little-too-late scenarios. Failure to coordinate a transition globally 
        risks significant supply chain constraints that stymie attempts to transition, whilst 
        a delay causes whiplash from a lack of clear long-term signals or roadmaps, misplacing 
        investments that ultimately fail to achieve the targeted limiting of global average 
        temperature rise.
        
        This delayed and divergent transition leads to a temperature rise of 2.3deg;C corresponding 
        to physical risk levels similar to that seen in the Current Policies scenario. The physical 
        effects of climate change on utilities can be decomposed into the chronic, such as raised 
        sea-levels and acute changes in the frequency and severity of weather events such as 
        heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones and flooding. These effects will definitionally 
        be larger in high physical risk scenarios with significant disruptions to the utility sector. 
        Effects on profitability and valuations through this channel will be highly dependent on the 
        locational characteristics of the underlying assets.

        Regional changes in carbon prices, energy prices and energy mix are likely to dominate 
        transition risk impacts with policy changes likely to diverge across regions in a 
        Fragmented World scenario, especially post-2030 when certain countries increase 
        their decarbonisation while others simply continue with current policies. The 
        misaligned efforts across regions and sectors leads to higher transition risk 
        than in the Delayed Transition scenario.

        Despite (or in some cases because of) the nature of the scenario, Solar PV and 
        Wind are still the dominant technologies over time, as existing cost decisions 
        allow them to take the majority of the market, relative to the more capital intensive 
        fossil fuels, nuclear, or large-scale renewables such as hydropower or biomass. The 
        delay in transition prevents early price signals that enable infrastructure to be 
        developed supporting low-carbon baseload power generation from other types of renewables, 
        leading to a relative overweighting in variable renewables. However noting this trend will 
        also vary significantly from region to region. As a result, globally, solar and wind 
        become the dominant technologies, displacing coal and gas but not uniformly across 
        jurisdictions.

        However, under a Fragmented World scenario, the lack of a coordinated, accelerated 
        effort to increase non-fossil fuel electricity generation also means insufficient 
        investments are made in the years up to 2030 when compared to the Net Zero 2050 
        scenario to transition effectively.
        
        Firms operating in the Too-Little-Too-Late scenario pathway face the greatest 
        challenges in positioning themselves, as they are rocked by volatile and geographically 
        varied policy changes that prevent longer-term planning, price signalling, and risk 
        supply chain bottlenecks to any attempted transition, whilst the failure of the 
        transition globally poses significant physical risks. Investment is likely to be 
        similarly volatile, with sudden price signal and valuation changes, political and 
        reputational risks, and an inability to plan longer term investments. Both firms 
        and investors in a Too--little-too-late scenario need to account for the sector’s 
        diversity and be very selective in their approach. Caution must be applied when 
        assessing the level of transition risk priced in, noting potentially significant 
        divergence across jurisdictions and energy technologies in a Fragmented World scenario.
        
        This delayed and divergent transition in the high physical and transition risk scenario 
        leads to a temperature rise of 2.3&deg;C corresponding to physical risk levels similar to 
        that seen in the Current Policies scenario. Utilities are exposed to the chronic and 
        acute threats of physical climate change, and this is exacerbated in a High physical 
        and transition risk (Too-little-too-late world) scenario. Different utility activities 
        are exposed for a variety of reasons. The following (non-exhaustive) examples illustrate 
        how the utilities sector could be impacted by the high physical risks: 
  
        **Chronic Impacts**
        
        - **Rising sea-levels**: this can cause existing power, heat, and water 
          infrastructure to be forced to migrate from low-lying coastal areas, 
          and saltwater intrusion threatens potable water reservoirs and resources 
          to those already stressed communities.
        
        - **Chronic water stress from changes in precipitation patterns and rising average temperatures**: 
          this would increase the cost and reduce the availability of water, with shortages in water 
          directly effecting water utilities’ ability to service communities, or the ability for hydropower 
          to generate electricity from reduced water resources, or otherwise stress thermal power generation 
          which relies on water for cooling and as the working fluid for power generation, reducing their 
          efficiency, safety, and potentially forcing shutdowns. Increasing average temperatures increase 
          the demand for water, adding to this water stress.
        
        - **Higher temperatures**: this may cause significant direct and indirect stresses 
          from reduced efficiencies for water, heat, and electric generation and distribution. 
          Increasing temperatures may lead to an increase in water resource fouling from algal 
          blooms, reduced efficiencies for thermal power plants or electricity distribution, 
          and increased variability in local weather (including “dunkelflaute” - periods of 
          low-wind and low-light conditions that reduce the effectiveness of wind and solar 
          power). As evidenced in the 2025 Global Energy Review, higher temperatures is a 
          major driver in increases in electricity demand for residential and commercial cooling, 
          and thus electricity demand is expected to grow faster than climate-agnostic business 
          demand would otherwise suggest.
        
        **Acute Impacts**
        
        - **Extreme weather events such as flooding, wildfires, and storms**: 
          this can cause direct damages or curtailment to utilities supply, transmission, 
          and distribution. Water resources can be contaminated, overhead powerlines or 
          substations damaged or destroyed, and powerplants made inoperable. The utilities 
          sector in particular is especially susceptible to these events given a lot of 
          generating infrastructure is located in areas exposed to increased flooding risk 
          as well as cyclone effects, and a large proportion of the value of most utilities 
          is comprised of tangible (physical) capital.
        
        There are many adaptation actions that companies can take to reduce the physical risks 
        mentioned above. These include, investing in resilient solutions e.g. underground power 
        line networks, disaster prevention systems (e.g. vegetation management to keep tree 
        limbs a safe distance from power lines) and increase contribution of electricity 
        businesses vs gas businesses. However, adaptation becomes more difficult and costly 
        as the extent of the temperature and climate change rises.
  
        The most serious, sustained impacts on asset prices are likely to manifest later in 
        the scenario horizon. Indeed, standard discounting methods generate relatively 
        moderate negative effects on utility security valuations, though there is naturally 
        significant variation depending on their locational characteristics.
        
        Users should be aware that the results in this tool are derived from a particular 
        energy-systems model (REMIND-MAgPIE), which makes particular assumptions about how 
        the relative costs of different technologies are likely to evolve over the longer-term. 
        The zero and low carbon ‘winners’ cannot be predicted with certainty. The relative 
        cost reductions and growth rates of solar and wind technologies, government nuclear 
        investment plans, and the viability of biomass, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage 
        technologies at greater scale are all highly uncertain.
        
        These models also tend to place a low weight on the role of nascent technologies. 
        Because alternative assumptions about future technology can generate vastly different 
        usage patterns across the renewable and fossil fuel types, users undertaking their own 
        analyses should test the sensitivity of their results to alternative models and assumptions.
