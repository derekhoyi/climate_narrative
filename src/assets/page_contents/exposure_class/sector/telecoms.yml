    The **telecommunication** (telecoms) sector is comprised of companies that
    provide telecommunications and services related to that activity (e.g.
    telephony, including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP); cable and satellite
    television distribution services; internet access; telecommunications
    reselling services). This sector is also engaged in operating, and/or
    providing access to facilities for the transmission of voice, data, text,
    sound, and video. Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology
    or a combination of technologies. This sector also includes firms that are 
    primarily engaged in:
  
    - Purchasing access and network capacity from owners and operators of
      telecommunications networks and reselling wired and wireless
      telecommunications services (except satellite) to businesses and households
  
    - Providing specialised telecommunications services, such as satellite
      tracking, communications telemetry, and radar station operation
  
    - Providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected
      with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting
      telecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite
      systems; or
  
    - Providing Internet access services or Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP)
      services via client-supplied telecommunications connections

      exec_description: |
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, the telecoms sector 
        could face rising operating costs as carbon pricing policies increase 
        energy prices, as well as falling asset values as current infrastructure 
        becomes increasingly obsolete. As the rise in shadow carbon price is 
        delayed and subsequently increases sharply, impact on companies is similar, 
        however varies by how reliant the company’s production / revenue mix is 
        on low-carbon electricity, the company’s transition plans and how they 
        compare to the sector average.
  
      always: |
        While telecoms could continue to play a role in meeting customer demand
        for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy generation, driven
        by divergent or late policy reaction, societal change, national energy
        strategies, and carbon legislation, are likely to have a significant and
        long term impact on this sector, affecting profitability and consumer
        preferences.
  
      high_materiality: |
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, the impacts could depend on how 
        reliant the company's production/revenue mix is on lower
        carbon electricity, the client's 'temperature alignment' score and how
        this compares to the sector average. For example:
  
        - **Increased operating costs**: the increases in carbon and energy prices
          could potentially result in financial impacts, as firms' carbon
          emissions face a rising price in the form of a carbon tax or cap and
          trade clearing price, particularly for copper and other lightweight
          materials commonly found in phones/ cables and network sites.
  
        - **Increased CapEx spend**: to use / develop energy efficient technologies 
          and products in the future. Failure to provide lower carbon emissions in 
          telecom material could affect the commercial reputation of the company and 
          could lead to loss of customers and a decrease in revenue.
  
        - **Changing consumer preferences**: these could lead to changes in sales
          due to new/lost customers as a result of change in environmental
          expectations and changes in demand as a result of societal changes.
  
        Increased carbon tax cost and new investment for renewables could increase 
        the electricity cost for the telecoms sector in the short-to-medium term, 
        peaking around 2035 in the Delayed Transition scenario at ~19 USD 
        (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) per gigajoule.

        The profitability of the telecoms sector, in the Delayed 
        Transition scenario, could also depend on the relevant companies
        proactively investing in innovation and new technology and their ability
        to mitigate transition risks. For example:
  
        - Invest in and roll out energy efficient technologies e.g. 5G & Fibre
          (balanced with expanding use cases driving energy consumption up);
  
        - Use electric vehicles for engineering truck fleets;
  
        - Switch to 100% renewables and green power purchase agreements (PPAs) for
          fixed and mobile networks;
  
        - Develop on site energy generation and sustainable energy sourcing
          (offsite PPAs);
  
        - Use natural resources more efficiently;
  
        - Use Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI)
          technologies to better forecast network energy demands and measure
          consumption. The uses and new capabilities are adding to these
          technologies and are growing at a year-on-year basis;
  
        - Improve device battery technologies and packaging reduction;
  
        - Embed sustainable supply chain & partnership strategy;
  
        - Use 'smart' network components which shutdown/start up in line with
          demand and usage;
  
        - Integrate E-Waste circular economy and smart recycling into consumer
          propositions (e.g. O2 Recycle) as well as refurbishing and reusing 
          telecom equipment;
  
        - Use 'Green Steel' in construction of telecoms infrastructure;
  
        - Develop technology to foster, or directly work on, solutions that
          minimise need for travel (e.g. BT's Remote Diagnostic Station);
      
        - Implement water conservation initiatives in data centres and 
          other facilities;
  
        - Collaborate with local communities to support environmental 
          projects and initiatives.
  
        These actions could also lead to positive gains in commercial reputation and
        therefore magnify demand and overall revenue as consumers could
        proactively shop at businesses with an incorporated green strategy.

      exec_description: |
        In high physical risk scenarios, extreme weather events could increase 
        disruption and cause damage to infrastructure, resulting in severe impacts 
        for the telecoms sector.
  
      always: |
        The telecoms sector is exposed to the chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels) 
        and acute effects (e.g. flooding, high winds, fire and extreme temperatures) 
        of a changing climate, which could cause service outages or degradation of 
        infrastructure. Whilst the telecom industry is used to responding to and 
        managing changing weather conditions, increased weather variations could 
        lead to increasing productivity disruption resulting in an increase in the 
        operational costs (as operations become largely reactive to remediate issues), 
        impact employment and potentially lead to a significant decline in revenue due 
        to an inability to operate and meet customer demands. These are likely to have 
        an impact on this sector, affecting profitability and consumer preferences.
  
      high_materiality: |
        The following examples illustrate how the telecoms sector could be impacted
        in a high physical risk scenario:
  
        - **Flooding events**: these could pose risks to the telecoms sector such as
          damage to infrastructure e.g. damage to facilities, water ingress and
          flooding of exchange buildings, base stations, cable ducts and chambers
          due to high rainfall and flooding. This could also impact suppliers 
          which produce essential components supporting this sector.
  
        - **Severe winds**: these could damage overhead access network, backhaul, and 
          core network via poles and pylons.
  
        - **Increase in wildfires frequency and severity**: this could also increase
          damage to infrastructure.
  
        - **Increase in precipitation**: leading to interruption to or reduction in
          quality of wireless service, and an increase in frequency or severity of
          damage to low-lying infrastructure, access holes, transport structures &
          underground facilities. For example, there could be disruptions to 
          services after data centres are flooded.
  
        - **Loss of power to the network**: if the national grid is impacted by weather,
          causing operational disruption.
  
        - **Extreme temperatures**: causing overheating of equipment in base
          stations or street cabinets.
  
        There are several mitigating actions telecom companies can take against the
        high physical risks mentioned above to build resiliency into the network
        against extreme weather events. For example, investing in more resilient
        solutions e.g. develop sustained requirement for heating/ cooling
        technologies across the network, invest in sustainable products and
        proposition development and invest in technologies which reduce the number
        of physical network sites needed (e.g. full fibre).

      exec_description: |
        In a scenario marked by high physical and transition risks, extreme 
        weather events coupled with inconsistent policy implementation could 
        escalate disruptions, damage critical infrastructure, and severely 
        impact the telecoms sector.
  
      always: |
        The telecom sector is exposed to both physical and transition risks. 
        Chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels) and acute effects 
        (e.g. flooding, high winds, fire and extreme temperatures) could cause 
        significant network damage or service impacts. Whilst the telecoms 
        industry is used to responding to and managing changing weather conditions, 
        increased weather variations could lead to lower productivity, resulting 
        in an increase in the operational costs (as operations become largely 
        reactive to remediate issues), impact employment and potentially lead 
        to a significant decline in revenue due to an inability to operate 
        and meet customer demands. These are likely to have a significant impact 
        on this sector, affecting profitability and consumer preferences.
        
        Transition risks such as regulatory changes, shifts in consumer preferences, 
        and technological advancements pose significant challenges. Inconsistent 
        policy implementation and evolving environmental regulations could lead 
        to increased compliance costs and operational complexities. The need to 
        adopt greener technologies and reduce carbon footprints may require 
        substantial investments, impacting financial stability. Furthermore, 
        the transition to renewable energy sources and sustainable practices 
        could disrupt existing operations and supply chains. These factors 
        could result in higher operational costs, affect employment, and 
        potentially lead to a significant decline in revenue due to an 
        inability to operate and meet customer demands. The combination 
        of high physical and transition risk is likely to have a profound 
        impact on the telecoms sector, affecting profitability and 
        consumer preferences.

        **Transition risk effects**:
  
        -	**Regulatory changes and evolving environmental regulations (including carbon taxes)**: 
          could lead to increased compliance costs and operational complexities.
  
        - **Shifts in consumer preferences**: towards greener technologies and 
          sustainable practices may require substantial investments, impacting 
          financial stability.
  
        - **Technological advancements**: necessitate continuous upgrades and 
          adaptations, which could disrupt existing operations and supply chains.
  
        - **Energy consumption**: for communication networks and data centres is 
          a significant operational expenditure, with the need to transition to 
          renewable energy sources.
  
        - **Inconsistent policy implementation**: could exacerbate operational 
          challenges and increase costs.
  
        Increased carbon tax cost and new investment for renewables could increase 
        the electricity cost for the telecoms sector in the short-to-medium term, 
        peaking around 2035 in the Fragmented World scenario at ~19 USD 
        (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) per gigajoule.
