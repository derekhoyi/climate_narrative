    **Unsecured retail lending** refers to a segment of the financial services that provides finance to individuals 
    without requiring collateral. The amount borrowed is based upon the borrower’s creditworthiness, income and 
    ability to repay, and the three broad product types offered are:
  
    - Credit Cards
    
    - Unsecured Personal Loans (UPL)
    
    - Personal Current Accounts in the form of Overdrafts (PCA)

    Since these loans are not backed by any physical asset, they typically carry higher interest rates compared to secured loans, which are backed by collateral.

        In Delayed transition risk scenario, unsecured retail lenders are likely to be impacted by a potential 
        decline in affordability as customers’ cost of living increases due to, for example, rising energy costs 
        and retrofitting costs.
      always: |
        In Delayed transition risk scenario, where the economy could experience a sharp shock, typical drivers 
        of unsecured losses, for example unemployment, are likely to worsen, generating significant losses for 
        unsecured retail lending.
        
        These scenarios could also result in changing patterns in energy generation, which may increase energy 
        costs, as well as changes to minimum Efficiency Performance Certificate (EPC) standards, which could create 
        retrofitting costs for property owners, affecting customers’ ability to repay balances. This could impact 
        affordability and generate losses for unsecured retail lending. The Delayed transition risk scenarios could 
        also lead to a moderate to severe reduction in GDP growth that could result in a significant increase of 
        unsecured losses.
      high_materiality: |
        The following examples show how the Unsecured retail lending exposure could be impacted in a Delayed 
        transition risk scenario:
        
        - Rising energy costs: are likely to put a significant strain on affordability, which poses a risk to 
        customers’ ability to repay balances. Customers may resort to increasing utilisation on their Credit Cards 
        and PCA which increases indebtedness on the book and, over time, will likely result in an increase in defaults.
        
        In Delayed transition risk scenario, natural gas, oil and coal prices increase throughout the period, with 
        oil and natural gas prices accelerating after 2040, where oil prices more than double by 2050. Electricity 
        prices are maintained until 2040 where they slowly start decreasing and intersect with natural gas prices.

        - **Retrofitting costs:** could also put a strain on affordability and generate significant losses (if not 
        mitigated by government subsidy) as consumers are required to spend significant sums to upgrade their 
        properties to minimum EPC standards. Currently the Government is consulting on plans for rental properties 
        to achieve a minimum EPC rating of C, and plans to reform and change the way EPCs are structured, resulting 
        in property owners’ need to renew their EPCs more often. Clearly this presents an opportunity to firms that 
        are able to support the unsecured financing of retrofitting products, but from a risk perspective this is 
        likely to have a short-term shock effect, particularly for highly indebted customers that would not ordinarily 
        meet minimum lending criteria to receive further credit.
        
        -	**Macro-economic effects:** The Delayed transition risk scenarios could also lead to a moderate to severe 
        reduction in GDP growth which could result in a significant increase of unsecured losses (due to, for example, 
        increased unemployment). However, this may be somewhat mitigated by the bank base rate outlook in these scenarios 
        which can ease the strain on affordability.
        
        Since many of these risk factors are shared across unsecured and secured lending, where possible, it is prudent 
        to look at the interaction effects between the portfolios. For example, it may be possible to identify pockets 
        of mortgage customers that are susceptible to certain types of climate-related transition risk (e.g. older 
        properties with high retrofitting costs) and infer that this could adversely affect unsecured lending exposures 
        the bank has to the customer. However, it should be considered that not all unsecured customers will also have 
        mortgages.
        
        Interconnectedness with other relevant client segments, products and risk types could also be considered 
        for a holistic assessment of potential losses arising from manifestation of climate risks. For example, 
        if climate risks manifest materially in the unsecured portfolios, sources of retail liquidity might be challenged 
        as well.

        In Orderly scenarios, unsecured retail lenders are likely to be impacted mainly due to a decline in affordability 
        as customers’ cost of living increases due to, for example, rising energy costs and retrofitting costs.
      always: |
        In Orderly scenarios, changing patterns in energy generation may increase energy costs, and changes to minimum 
        Efficiency Performance Certificate (EPC) standards could create retrofitting costs for property owners, affecting 
        customers’ ability to repay balances. This could impact affordability and generate losses for unsecured retail lending. 
        The Orderly scenarios could also lead to a limited fall in GDP growth which could result in further losses for unsecured 
        lending.
      high_materiality: |
        The following examples show how the unsecured retail lending exposure could be impacted in an Orderly scenario:
        
        -	**Rising energy costs:** are likely to put a strain on affordability which poses a risk to customers’ ability 
        to repay balances. Customers may resort to increasing utilisation on their Credit Cards and PCA which increases 
        indebtedness on the book and, over time, will likely result in an increase in defaults.
        
        In Orderly scenarios, electricity price increases in the short term, peaking around 2030, and remain above 2025 
        levels in 2035 before prices start decreasing again, whereas gas and coal prices increase throughout. Oil prices 
        show the highest exponential surge, surpassing electricity prices just before 2040 and exponentially increasing 
        in all Orderly scenarios, increasing the most significantly (almost tripling) in the Net Zero 2050 scenario due 
        to high carbon prices.

        In the High physical risk scenarios, unsecured retail lenders are likely to be impacted through macro-economic 
        effects typically associated with unsecured losses, as well as changes to affordability as customers’ cost of 
        living increases.
      always: |
        Chronic effects (e.g. rising sea-levels) due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather events such as 
        heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones and flooding could impact affordability as customers’ cost of living 
        increases (due to, for example, increased insurance costs) and indirectly result in losses for unsecured retail 
        lending.
  
      high_materiality: |
        The unsecured retail lending exposure could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario. For example, by 
        widespread increases to insurance premiums, which could affect customers’ ability to repay balances as a 
        result of more income being spent on insurance, potentially increasing probabilities of default, although 
        this will vary significantly based on geographical and external factors such as FloodRe. Also, as some 
        properties become uninsurable, or as customers elect not to prioritise premiums, the risk of one-off events 
        occurring that would severely impact on customers’ abilities to service outstanding debt will increase.

        In High physical and transition risk scenarios, unsecured retail lenders are likely to be impacted through 
        macro-economic effects typically associated with unsecured losses and increasing rising energy costs, as well 
        as changes to affordability as customers’ cost of living increases.
      always: |
        Chronic effects (e.g. rising sea-levels) due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather events such 
        as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones and flooding are projected to have macro-economic impacts, with 
        an adverse effect on world GDP assumed in these scenarios, which could result in losses for unsecured lending. 
        Physical risks may also impact affordability as customers’ cost of living increases (due to, for example, 
        increased insurance costs), and indirectly results in further losses for unsecured lending. Transition risks 
        are likely to put a significant strain on affordability, which poses a risk to customers’ ability to repay 
        balances.

        The following examples illustrate how the Unsecured retail lending exposure could be impacted in a high 
        physical and transition risk scenario:
        
        From a transition risk perspective:
        -	**Rising energy costs:** are likely to put a significant strain on affordability, which poses a risk 
        to customers’ ability to repay balances. Customers may resort to increasing utilisation on their Credit 
        Cards and PCA which increases indebtedness on the book and, over time, will likely result in an increase 
        in defaults.

        -	**Macro-economic effects:** the slower GDP growth would constrain household incomes and may be associated 
        with typical drivers of unsecured losses (for example unemployment). Banks are likely to be worse hit by these 
        impacts where customers are concentrated in areas with greater exposure to physical risks. However, this may 
        be somewhat mitigated by the bank base rate outlook in these scenarios which can ease the strain on affordability.
        
        From a high physical risk perspective:
        
        -	**Increases to insurance premiums:** are very likely and frequent, which could affect customers’ ability to 
        repay balances as a result of more income being spent on insurance, potentially increasing probabilities of default, 
        although this will vary significantly based on geographical and external factors such as FloodRe. Also, as some 
        properties become uninsurable, or as customers elect not to prioritise premiums, the risk of one-off events occurring 
        that would severely impact on customers’ abilities to service outstanding debt will increase.

        that are susceptible to certain types of physical risks (e.g. those in high flood risk areas) and infer that this could

  appendix: |
    As discussed throughout this section, it can be challenging to produce granular results 
    in terms of climate risk quantification for the Unsecured lending asset class.  As a result, 
    a suitable modelling approach could be to focus on high level climate-adjusted input variables 
    in the core modelling (e.g. macroeconomic variables) overlaid with additional risk 
    considerations such as cost of retrofitting and higher utilisation due to rising energy 
    prices. 
    
    As well as considering each of these factors in isolation, a comprehensive review of climate risk 
    on the Unsecured portfolio should measure interactions between factors which could exacerbate losses. 
    Particular attention should be paid to pockets of concentration risk (e.g. customers within geographical 
    regions subject to severe flood risks or types of business) which may not be visible under a high-level 
    approach which doesn't model behaviour at an account level.  It may also be useful to compare correlations 
    between susceptibility to climate risks and traditional risk factors measured through PD scores or bureau 
    information which would increase risk of losses. On a forward-looking basis, interconnectedness with 
    potential losses from other segments, products or risk types could also be considered to manage climate 
    risks holistically (e.g. if climate risks manifest materially in the unsecured portfolios, sources of retail 
    liquidity might be challenged).
    
    The following examples identify some general challenges around modelling Climate Risk for 
    unsecured portfolios:
    
    - Relatively high default rates on these products (compared to Mortgages for example) means 
      that extrapolating annual PDs over a long time horizon results in a high proportion of 
      the book in default at the end of scenario, especially in a static balance sheet exercise 
      where defaulting is an absorbing state. This raises an interesting challenge around the 
      concept of 'survivorship bias' and how to accurately estimate default rates several decades 
      into the future. The natural rate of defaulting, which occurs irrespective of the prevailing 
      economic conditions, may outweigh the signal from climate specific impacts in any given 
      scenario.
    
    - Account-level modelling over a significant time horizon on high volume portfolios 
      (e.g. PCA, Consumer Cards) can pose a challenge in terms of required processing power 
      which may require simplifications to the modelling approach.
  
    - As discussed, an accurate view of interaction effects between Secured and Unsecured risk 
      factors requires a single customer view which may require linking together data across 
      various platforms, products and models, which may present operational challenges.
    
    - Modelling losses on a closed book over a significant time horizon for products that have 
      relatively short product life (e.g. UPL) can create difficulties in interpreting results, 
      particularly as it is not possible to account for proactive or reactive changes in lending 
      strategy that would occur as economic circumstances change. 
  
    - Even in cases where account level data is available, it is not always possible to discern 
      how funds from new lending are being spent. This makes it difficult to assess whether there 
      are any additional first-order climate impacts that should be accounted for.
