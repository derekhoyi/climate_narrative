    # Construction 
    
    The **construction** sector includes establishments primarily responsible for
    the construction of buildings. The work performed may include new work,
    additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. The onsite assembly of
    pre-cut, panelised, and prefabricated buildings and construction of temporary
    buildings are also included in this sector. Establishments in this sector are
    classified based on the types of buildings they construct. The construction 
    sector includes companies that are, for example, involved in the following:
    
    - The construction of residential and commercial buildings. This also
      includes remodelling or renovating work for the buildings.
    
    - The construction of distribution lines and related buildings and structures
      for utilities (i.e. water, sewer, petroleum, gas, power, and communication)
      or the structures that are integral parts of the utility systems (power
      plants, sewer lines, oil and gas pipelines, telecommunications
      transmitting/receiving towers, etc.)
    
    - The construction of highways (including elevated), streets, roads, airport
      runways, public sidewalks, bridges, and other heavy and civil engineering
      constructions.
    
    - The installation or servicing of equipment that is part of building
      mechanical systems such as plumbing, heating, electrical wiring, etc.

      exec_description: |
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, the construction sector faces 
        rising operating costs as carbon pricing policies increase building 
        material and energy prices, as well as falling asset values as 
        current infrastructure becomes increasingly obsolete. 
        These impacts are like the Orderly transition scenarios, however due 
        to the delay in action until 2030, stronger policy action is needed 
        which causes more pronounced impacts in the short-term. 
      always: |
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, the demand for construction is 
        likely to increase. The construction sector was responsible for 13% 
        of global GDP in 2020, and this share is expected to increase as the 
        global population continues to rise. However, these scenarios could 
        also lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This could partially offset 
        growth in demand for the construction sector.
        
        While the construction sector could continue to play a role in meeting 
        customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy 
        generation in the Delayed Transition scenario results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
        increasing until 2030 before rapidly decreasing after 2030 as carbon 
        prices are increased to compensate for the inaction beforehand. 
        These are likely to have a significant and more pronounced short-term 
        impact on the profitability of this sector; constructing assets such 
        as buildings, roads, railways, tunnels and bridges involves emitting 
        carbon, primarily through electricity use, fuel usage for 
        vehicles and plant, and from the production of materials, such as 
        steel and cement. As per Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction 
        (Global ABC) report, in 2024/25, the Buildings and Construction sector 
        accounted for 32% of global energy consumption and 34% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
        (Global-Status-Report-2024_2025_0.pdf).
  
      high_materiality: |
        The changes in carbon pricing, societal preference, energy prices and
        energy mix could potentially impact the construction sector as a result in one or
        more of the following financial impacts:
        
        - **Reduced Revenues**. Negative public sentiment around sustainability 
        and climate change issues can affect all the value chain players leading 
        to reduced demand for products and services.
        
        - **Disruptive increased costs** This could occur from paying a price on 
        carbon emissions directly or indirectly through expensive conventional 
        building material or non-renewable energy for its operations. Due to 
        delayed actions, the emission intensity of construction processes could 
        have a limited scope of improvement.
        
        - **Increased capital expenditures.** New investments could be required to 
        improve the energy efficiency of the construction process including but not 
        limited to using fewer or different materials, employing different 
        production techniques, using lower emission transportation, optimizing 
        transportation routes, planning fewer journeys, minimising the use of 
        non-renewable grid energy and recycling.
        
        - **Increased R&D investments** This could be needed to explore alternative 
        construction processes and materials to improve the emission intensity.
        
        - **Falling asset values.** This could be due to the impairment of the 
        economic value of company assets such as outdated machinery and material 
        transportation vehicles with poor energy efficiency.
        
        
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, the construction sector is likely to be 
        impacted by rapid decarbonisation in building materials such as cement, 
        chemicals and steel, as well as in its own operations. The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
        for cement industry reduces from ~1.5 billion tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>/yr to just 
        above 5 million tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>/yr.

        Emission from energy consumption in cement reduce greatly by 2050, namely from ~1.5 billion 
        to ~700 million tonne CO<sub>2</sub> for the Delayed Transition scenario. Regardless however, a large 
        portion of cement industry CO<sub>2</sub> emissions arise as a by-product of a chemical conversion 
        process and thus cannot be reduced through a change in fuel mix or efficiency. A sharper 
        focus would be required for the cement industry to instead improve its clinker-to-cement 
        ratio and deploy carbon storage technologies. Due to this limited capacity to improve CO<sub>2</sub> 
        intensity, among building materials, cement could incur the most impact in the face of an 
        increasing carbon price.

        The construction sector is also likely to be impacted by rapid decarbonisation in energy mix. 
        Primary energy mix of renewables rises from ~25% in 2030, to almost 65% of global primary 
        energy needs in the Delayed Transition scenario. Increased carbon tax cost and new 
        investment for renewables could increase the electricity cost for the construction 
        industry in the short-to-medium term.

        The construction sector is also likely to be impacted by rapid decarbonisation in transport. 
        The portion of electric energy used in freight transport increases from 2% in 2030 to 16% by 
        2050 in the Delayed Transition scenario.
        
        The profitability of the construction sector, in the Delayed Transition scenario, could also 
        depend on the relevant companies proactively investing in innovation and new technology and 
        respond quickly to changing regulations and customer preferences. It is critical that energy 
        efficiency improvements are made in the design and construction, as well as in the operations 
        of buildings. It is estimated that the total GHG emissions from building material is largely 
        concentrated in just 10 commonly used items: cement, steel, limestone, structural clay, aluminium, 
        etc. Decarbonising steel and concrete production currently represent a significant challenge. 
        The alternative is to substitute such materials, where possible, for lower-carbon intensity 
        products, and increase recycling.

        In orderly transition scenarios, the construction sector could 
        face rising operating costs as carbon pricing policies increase building material 
        and energy prices, as well as falling asset values as current infrastructure 
        becomes increasingly obsolete.As the transition is smooth and orderly, i.e., 
        carbon prices rise gradually, these impacts are manageable.
  
      always: |
        In orderly transition scenarios, the demand for
        construction is likely to increase. The construction sector was
        responsible for 13% of global GDP in 2020, and this share is expected to
        increase as the global population continues to rise. However, the Disorderly
        transition scenarios could also lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This could partially 
        offset growth in demand for the construction sector.
        
        While the construction sector could continue to play a role in meeting
        customer demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy
        generation in orderly transition scenario, driven by immediate policy
        reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation, 
        could lead to an immediate and smooth reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050.
        these are likely to have an impact on the profitability of this
        sector; constructing assets such as buildings, roads, railways, tunnels and 
        bridges involves emitting carbon, primarily through electricity use, fuel usage for
        vehicles and plant, and from the production of materials, such as steel
        and cement. As per [Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (Global

        over 34% of global energy consumption and 34% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

        and steel, as well as in its own operations.

        In the Hot House World scenarios, both the severity and frequency of physical risk events 
        are expected to increase exponentially, resulting in severe impacts for the construction sector.
      always: |
        The construction sector is one of the most exposed sectors to physical impacts of climate change, 
        chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels) and acute effects due to changes to frequency and 
        severity of weather events such as heatwaves, winds, storms and flooding. Whilst the 
        construction industry is used to responding to and managing changing weather conditions, 
        in the high physical risk scenario, global warming could increase the weather variations. 
        This could lead to physical damages to buildings as well as disruption to the construction 
        process, which may decrease profitability for the construction industry.
      
  
      high_materiality: |
        The following examples illustrate how the construction sector could be
        impacted in a high physical risk scenario:
        
        **Chronic Impacts**
        
        - **Rising sea levels** could cause disruption to the construction process
          and can also lead to reduced demand in particular markets and locations
          such as coastal areas.
        
        - **Heatwaves and rising temperatures** this can reduce productivity, 
          slowing the construction process and even stop work for health and 
          safety reasons while also potentially compromising the structural 
          integrity of the materials, causing machinery malfunctions, and 
          increasing fire risk. In the Current Policies and Nationally 
          Determined Contributions scenarios, mean air temperatures, as 
          well as mean daily minimum and maximum air temperatures, are 
          projected to increase significantly, from between 
          1.3 – 1.4&deg;c in 2030 to between 2 – 2.2&deg;c in 2050 across 
          both scenarios.

        - **High winds and storms** are known to be a risk to construction.
          Cyclones are likely becoming more intense leading to
          construction timelines getting extended or disrupted. The annual 
          expected economic damages in hot house scenario is increasing 
          from 8.9% change in 2030 to ~20% change in 2050.

        - **Heavy precipitation and flooding** can cause significant damage to
          project sites with infrastructure collapsing and exposed materials
          getting damaged. In both the Current Policies and Nationally 
          Determined Contribution scenarios, precipitation is projected 
          to increase from 2.65% change in 2030 to ~3.5%-3.6% change in 
          2050 relative to the 1986-2006 reference period.

        There are many mitigating actions companies can take against the physical
        risks mentioned above. For example, increasing the durability of materials
        against extreme weather conditions, improved drainage systems and better
        equipment to be able to withstand stronger cyclones. To reduce the
        impact of rising sea levels, the position of new facilities should
        consider climate change to minimise the risk of total damage caused by
        flooding.

          non-renewable energy for its operations.
        
          **Increased capital expenditures:** New investments could be required to 
          improve the energy efficiency of the construction process including but not 
          limited to using fewer or different materials, employing different production 
          techniques, using lower emission transportation, optimizing transportation 
          routes, planning fewer journeys, minimising the use of non-renewable grid 
          energy and recycling.
        
          **Increased R&D investments:** could be needed to explore alternative 
          construction processes and materials to improve the emission intensity.
          **Falling asset values:** due to impairment of the economic value of 
          company assets such as outdated machinery and material transportation 
          vehicles with poor energy efficiency.
        
          From a physical risk perspective, mean air temperatures, as well as mean daily 
          minimum and maximum air temperatures, are projected to increase significantly, 
          from between 1.3 – 1.4&deg;c in 2030 to ~2&deg;c in 2050 in the Fragmented World scenario.

         Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for construction 
         through its effect on individuals’ disposable income and government spending.   
        
         There are many mitigating actions companies can take against the physical 
         risks mentioned above. For example, increasing the durability of materials 
         against extreme weather conditions, improved drainage systems and better 
         equipment to be able to withstand stronger cyclones, a more robust design 
         of infrastructure and stricter construction standards. To reduce the impact 
         of rising sea levels, the position of new facilities should consider climate 
         change to minimise the risk of total damage caused by flooding.  
        
         From a transition risk perspective, the construction sector is likely 
         to be impacted by the inability to decarbonizedecarbonise building 
         materials such as cement, chemicals and steel, as well as in its 
         own operations. As shown below, carbon policy measures fail to reduce 
         emissions in the production of cement, critical to the construction 
         sector, which instead rises.

         Emission from energy consumption in cement reduce only gradually, 
         namely from ~1.1 billion in 2030 to 870 million tonne CO2 in 2050; 
         coupled with the slight raise in carbon prices, therefore has knock 
         on impacts on profitability of the sector. In addition to this, a large 
         portion of cement industry CO2 emissions arise as a by-product of the chemical 
         conversion process and thus cannot be reduced through a change in fuel mix or 
         efficiency. Due to this limited capacity to improve CO2 intensity, among 
         building materials, cement could incur the most impact in the face of 
         an increasing carbon price.

         The construction sector is further impacted by the inability of 
         transportation to decarbonizedecarbonise. The portion of electric 
         energy used in freight transport rises only slightly in the Fragmented 
         World scenario from 2% in 2030 to between 13% by 2050 and is the lowest 
         across scenarios except for the Current Policies scenario.

         The profitability of the construction sector, therefore, could depend on the 
         relevant companies proactively investing in innovation and new technology. It is 
         critical that energy efficiency improvements are made in the design and construction, 
         as well as in the operations of buildings. It is estimated that the total GHG emissions 
         from building material is largely concentrated in just 10 commonly used items: cement, 
         steel, limestone, structural clay, aluminium, etc. Decarbonising steel and concrete 
         production currently represent a significant challenge. The alternative is to 
         substitute such materials, where possible, for lower-carbon intensity products, 
         and increase recycling.
