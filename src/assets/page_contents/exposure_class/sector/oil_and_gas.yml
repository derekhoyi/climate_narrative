    The **Oil and Gas** sector comprises three main activities along their operational chain - upstream
    (exploration and production), midstream (transportation and processing) and
    downstream (distribution and sale to end users/consumers). This sector
    includes companies that are, for example, involved in the following:
  
    - the exploration/extraction, development and/or the production of natural gas from wells
      in which the hydrocarbons could initially flow or can be produced using
      normal or enhanced drilling and extraction techniques;
  
    - the production of crude petroleum from reservoirs in which the hydrocarbons
      are semi-solids;
  
    - the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from oil and gas field gases;
  
    - manufacturing machinery and equipment for the use in the Oil and Gas sector
      or for drilling water wells, including portable drilling rigs;
  
    - producing gasoline, kerosene, distillate fuel oils and residual fuel oils
      through refraction or straight distillation of crude oil, redistillation,
      cracking or other processes;
  
    - transmission, distribution and storage of natural gas for sale; and
  
    - operating oil and gas wells as well as those engaged in providing support
      services.

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, demand for oil and gas decreases, 
        which could affect profitability of individual companies and the sector overall. 
  
      always: |
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Climate Scenarios, REMIND model, by 2050, in a
        Delayed Transition scenario, fossil fuels represent only
        36% of global energy demand compared to ~81% in 2025. Carbon-intensive
        sectors such as Oil and Gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable
        to the transition. In a Delayed Transition scenario, earlier delays in 
        policy ambition reduces the impetus to transition the global energy 
        mix until 2030, where a sudden increase in decarbonisation ambition 
        leads to a sharp decline in demand for fossil fuels.
  
        While oil and gas could continue to play a role in meeting global energy
        demand in the short-term, the changing patterns in energy
        consumption, driven by societal change, national energy strategies, and
        carbon legislation, are likely to have a significant and long-term impact
        on demand for oil and gas, affecting profitability of individual companies 
        and the sector overall. The policy and economic conditions described in the
        Delayed Transition Scenario could result in changes in the demand for 
        the Oil and Gas sector. 
  
      high_materiality: |
        The changes in effective carbon pricing, energy demand/mix and energy prices could 
        potentially result in one or more of the following financial impacts:
  
        - **Reduced revenue**: this may occur for Oil and Gas firms due to the 
        decline in fossil fuel demand driven by the rise in demand for electricity 
        and low-carbon alternatives. This is especially apparent for firms with no 
        transition plans (i.e., no diversified into alternative energy sources). 
        As seen below, there is a sharp decrease in the demand for oil and gas. 
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, consumption of oil and gas combined 
        falls from ~350 exajoules per year to between ~180 exajoules per year by 2050. 
        The decrease is steeper for gas as the electricity grid is decarbonised rapidly, 
        directly competing with the growth of renewables, and the electrification of heat 
        reduces demand of gas. Oil demand is less elastic as it is primarily driven by 
        transportation as opposed to electricity. Oil demand does however still steadily 
        decrease, primarily due to the electrification of road transportation.

        [[IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer.] REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8.](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/downloads)
        
        A reduction in demand leads to both a reduction in aggregate sales volume, 
        and a reduction in the pricing power that firms have in transitioning sectors.
  
        - **Increase in regulatory costs**: both from paying an explicit price on 
          carbon emissions via tax or cap & trade clearing programs, as well as 
          from the cost of compliance (or penalties of non-compliance) with e
          missions reductions programs, such as fugitive emissions capture.
  
        - **Increased costs of goods sold**: this may occur as carbon prices 
          (both real and effective) increase operational costs. In conjunction with 
          a decline in demand, there could be a decrease in profit margins for 
          supplying fossil energy, negatively impacting the profitability of 
          Oil and Gas companies. Additionally, the historical push towards 
          unconventional oil and gas reserves has increased the operating costs 
          of fields that are currently in development, and thus the breakeven price 
          of the fossil fuels to maintain profitability.
  
        - **Increases in capital expenditures**: this may be required with new 
          investments required to pivot business models towards low carbon energy 
          production, renewable biofuels/hydrogen/synthetic and/or Carbon Capture, 
          Usage and Storage (CCUS), assuming firms do not choose to engage in a 
          “planned” or “managed decline”.
  
        - **Falling asset values**: this may occur for existing oil and gas reserves 
          and infrastructure required for extraction based on re-adjusted market 
          expectations of a lower demand of fossil fuels in the future. There are 
          risks of stranding assets that cannot be retrofitted, repurposed, or whose 
          cost of extraction cannot be reduced to improve profitability of the fuels 
          extracted. In a Delayed Transition scenario, the market signals from 
          decarbonisation policy are late to arrive, increasing the risk of further 
          investment into assets until a correction in policy occurs and the price signal 
          suddenly shifts against high-carbon assets. As this occurs market wide, there 
          would be significant risks of Oil and Gas firms not being able to retreat from 
          the losses endured in a Delayed Transition scenario for myopic investments.
  
        - **Litigation and business disruption**: this may occur as the social licence 
          of Oil and Gas businesses is eroded significantly. The erosion of social license 
          may also increase costs for fines when non-climate related incidents occur such 
          as oil spills. These incidents are made more likely as aging infrastructure fails 
          to receive investments required to maintain them.
        
        This costs and reductions to the price of fossil fuels erode at both ends the profit 
        margins and the overall profitability of the Oil and Gas sectors in the 
        Delayed Transition Scenario. 
  
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, capital investments into fossil fuel extraction 
        and supply are significantly lower than investment into renewable electricity and 
        storage after 2030 when strong policy ambition leads to rapid decarbonisation. 
        There is still some legacy capital investment in fossil fuel extraction to maintain 
        the existing infrastructure while phasing down the overall capacity.

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, the Oil and Gas sector is likely to be 
        significantly impacted. There is a steady but rapid increase in electricity 
        demand from the electrification of demand, on top of a sudden steep decline 
        in liquid and especially gaseous fuel demand, driven by the changes in global 
        ambition to decarbonisation. Thus after 2030, the demand falls steeply for 
        fossil gas and oil.
        
        For gas, the decrease is steeper, especially after 2030, as the electricity 
        grid is decarbonised rapidly, directly competing with the growth of renewables, 
        and the electrification of heat reduces demand of gas. Oil demand is less 
        substitutable as it is primarily driven by transportation as opposed to electricity. 
        Oil demand does however still steadily decrease, primarily due to the electrification 
        of road transportation - the largest current consumer of oil. For both Oil and Gas, 
        the use of them as fuels is not only reduced by electrification of demand, but by 
        competition in the provision of liquids and gaseous fuels by bioenergy and hydrogen.
        
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, consumption of oil and gas combined falls from 
        ~350 exajoules per year to between ~180 exajoules per year by 2050.
        
        Primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price at the global market) for Oil and Gas 
        rise above 2020 levels, due to the increased operational costs to comply with the 
        policy landscape, partially passed to downstream consumers. In addition, the 
        reduction of demand reduces the scope of downstream consumers of oil and gas to 
        those who have less optionality with energy sources (such as shipping and aviation 
        for oil demand) and thus have more inelastic demand to the price increases.

        Under the Delayed Transition scenario, belated awareness by financial 
        market participants of the scale and speed of the transition required 
        may cause fossil fuel assets to undergo a fire-sale by investors, at the 
        moment when they fully understand the real risk involved in holding these 
        in their portfolios.
        
        Because of the scale and variety within the Oil and Gas sector, there is 
        no single adaptation strategy that can be adopted, but a range of possible 
        strategies exist based on the circumstances each company faces. Examples 
        include “Managed Decline” where a business winds down the business operations 
        in a planned manner in keeping with their fiduciary duties to shareholders, 
        r transitioning the business model from a traditional Oil and Gas company to 
        an “Integrated Energy” company by switching to supplying renewable energy, 
        among others.

        In Orderly transition scenarios, there is a significant reduction in the

      always: |
        Based on the IIASA NGFS Climate Scenarios, REMIND model, by 2050, in
        Orderly Transition scenarios, there is a significant reduction in fossil 
        fuel energy demand, declining from ~81% in 2025 to between ~19% to ~41% 
        in 2050. This significant shift highlights the vulnerability of carbon-intensive 
        sectors such as oil and gas as the world transition to cleaner energy sources. 
        
        While oil and gas could continue to play a role in meeting global energy demand 
        in the short-term, the changing patterns in energy consumption, driven by 
        societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation, are 
        likely to have a significant and long-term impact on demand for oil and gas, 
        affecting profitability of individual companies and the sector overall. 
        The policy and economic conditions described in Orderly Transition scenarios 
        could result in changes in the demand for the Oil and Gas sector.

        A reduction in demand leads to both a reduction in aggregate sales volume, 
        and a reduction in the pricing power that firms have in transitioning sectors.

        Overall, demand for both oil and gas decreases significantly as the share of 
        renewables in the energy mix increases.
        
        Primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price at the global market) for oil 
        and gas rise above 2020 levels, due to the increased operational costs to 
        comply with the policy landscape, partially passed to downstream consumers. 
        More significantly, reductions in overall demand starts with the sectors 
        where oil and gas are most substitutable for alternatives. The remaining 
        consumers of oil and gas are those sectors such as shipping and 
        aviation - hard-to-abate sectors that lack significant substitutions in 
        energy supply. The lack of optionality the remaining consumers have decreases 
        the price elasticity of oil and gas. As oil and gas become more inelastic 
        commodities for this reduced set of consumers of fossil fuels, the pricing 
        power of Oil and Gas firms goes up, and the price charged for the dwindling 
        demand of fossil fuels increases. The role of competition is not modelled 
        within traditional Integrated Assessment Models such as NGFS, and thus the 
        real-world price dynamics are harder to predict as any reduction of demand 
        scenario leads to an overall oversupply, and price competition between 
        Oil and Gas firms would drive the prices down.

        Based on the IIASA NGFS Climate Scenarios, REMIND model, by 2050,
        renewables and biomass could cover ~80% of global primary energy needs 
        in a Net Zero 2050 scenario, compared to below 20% in 2025), driving 
        stranding of fossil fuel assets, and cannibalisation of profitability, 
        if firms fail to adapt to the changing market.

        The Oil and Gas sector involves significant and geographically concentrated 
        physical assets that are especially exposed to the chronic and acute physical 
        impact of climate change and extreme weather events. 
  
      always: |
        The Oil and Gas sector is highly exposed to the physical impacts of
        climate change including both the chronic effects (e.g., raised sea-levels and 
        global mean temperatures) and acute effects due to changes in the frequency and 
        severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones and
        flooding. 
        
        Whilst the Oil and Gas industry is used to responding to and
        managing changing weather conditions, in the High Physical Risk (Hot House World) 
        scenario, climate change will increase the severity and occurrence of 
        extreme weather events, and weather variations. This could lead to 
        increasing disruption to oil and gas production which could impact the 
        profitability for these companies, and increased volatility in the price 
        of oil and gas supply. Oil and Gas firms are especially exposed as their 
        assets are geographically concentrated and cannot be migrated to safer 
        locations.
  
      high_materiality: |
        The following examples illustrate how the Oil and Gas sector could be
        impacted in a High Physical Risk (Hot House World) scenario:
  
        **Chronic Impacts**
  
        - **Rising sea levels**: this could cause disruption to coastal 
          refineries and terminals, especially when compounded with storm 
          surge events, such as those generated by cyclones. For example, 
          Hurricane Ida caused massive disruptions to the U.S. energy sector, 
          particularly in the Gulf Coast region. As a result of this hurricane, 
          96% of crude oil production and 94% of natural gas production in the 
          U.S. federally administered areas of the Gulf of Mexico were shut in. 
          Additionally, at least 9 refineries shut down or reduced operations 
          during that time.
  
        - **Water stress/long-term drought**: this could lead to competition
          between Oil and Gas companies for water resources.There is a chance that 
          it could lead to increased environmental regulation focusing on protecting 
          water supply from excess withdrawal and from pollution, with the Oil and Gas 
          sector being affected in both ways.
  
        - **Thawing permafrost**: this could lead to areas of pipeline subsidence, 
          causing damage and associated increased maintenance costs.
  
        **Acute Impacts**
  
        - **Cyclones**: this could have an effect on the construction, offshore 
          production, onshore processing and decommission phases of oil and gas 
          projects resulting from either short-term disruption or damage to 
          facilities. These conditions could also lead to spills/leaks resulting 
          in additional clean-up costs.
  
        - **Floods**: this could pose serious risks to the Oil and Gas sector such as
          damage to facilities, refineries, loss of production, and increasing risks of 
          dispersal of salt and chemicals from coal seam gas mines onto farming land.
  
        - **Wildfires**: especially due to the highly flammable nature of methane, this 
          could be induced or exacerbated by gas vented from leaks in pipelines and 
          compressors. These would be ignited by sparks or embers from existing 
          bushfires and cause significant damage to fossil fuel infrastructure.
  
        Oil and Gas assets are mostly limited by geographical constraints due to the 
        location of reserves, and thus the risks above cannot be averted by relocation 
        of supply. Some actions remain to mitigate the physical risks however, namely 
        investing in the weatherisation of offshore rigs, improved drainage systems, 
        and better storm-resilient equipment. Terminals must remain on costs and thus 
        are exposed to rising sea levels and storm surges, but refineries are capable 
        of being relocated to consider climate change risks, especially those caused 
        by flooding.

        uncoordinated, and fragmented decarbonisation policy further negatively affects 
        product demands and operating costs for this sector, exposing it to transition 
        risks. 
  
      always: |
        The Oil and Gas sector is highly exposed to the physical impacts of climate 
        change including both the chronic effects (e.g. rising sea-levels) and acute 
        effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather events such as 
        heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones and flooding. Whilst the Oil and Gas 
        industry is used to responding to and managing changing weather conditions, in 
        the High Physical Risk and Transition Risk scenario, climate change and global 
        warming could increase weather variations. This could lead to increasing 
        disruption to oil and gas production which could impact the profitability 
        for these companies.
        
        Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the scenario 
        and these vary in line with different temperatures projected. The High Physical 
        and Transition Risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario could therefore also lead to 
        a significant GDP impact which could negatively affect demand for oil and gas. 
        
        In some jurisdictions, a response to climate change may still lead to significant 
        risks to businesses in the Oil and Gas sector due to the decarbonisation policies 
        emplaced. This induces transition risks from reduced demand for fossil fuels for 
        these businesses. 
        
        While oil and gas could continue to play a role in meeting global energy demand 
        in the short-term, the changing patterns in energy consumption, driven by societal 
        change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation, are likely to have a 
        significant and long-term impact on demand for oil and gas, affecting profitability 
        of individual companies and the sector overall. The policy and economic conditions 
        described in High Physical and Transition risk Scenarios could result in changes 
        in the demand for the Oil and Gas sector.
  
      high_materiality: |
        The following examples illustrate how the Oil and Gas sector could be
        impacted in a High Physical and Transition Risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario:
  
        **Chronic Impacts**
  
        - **Rising sea levels**: this could cause disruption to coastal 
          refineries and terminals, especially when compounded with storm 
          surge events, such as those generated by cyclones. For example, 
          Hurricane Ida caused massive disruptions to the U.S. energy sector, 
          particularly in the Gulf Coast region. As a result of this hurricane, 
          96% of crude oil production and 94% of natural gas production in the 
          U.S. federally administered areas of the Gulf of Mexico were shut in. 
          Additionally, at least 9 refineries shut down or reduced operations 
          during that time.
  
        - **Water stress/long-term drought**: this could lead to competition
          between Oil and Gas companies for water resources.There is a chance that 
          it could lead to increased environmental regulation focusing on protecting 
          water supply from excess withdrawal and from pollution, with the Oil and Gas 
          sector being affected in both ways.
  
        - **Thawing permafrost**: this could lead to areas of pipeline subsidence, 
          causing damage and associated increased maintenance costs.
  
        **Acute Impacts**
  
        - **Cyclones**: this could have an effect on the construction, offshore 
          production, onshore processing and decommission phases of oil and gas 
          projects resulting from either short-term disruption or damage to 
          facilities. These conditions could also lead to spills/leaks resulting 
          in additional clean-up costs.
  
        - **Floods**: this could pose serious risks to the Oil and Gas sector such as
          damage to facilities, refineries, loss of production, and increasing risks of 
          dispersal of salt and chemicals from coal seam gas mines onto farming land.
  
        - **Wildfires**: especially due to the highly flammable nature of methane, this 
          could be induced or exacerbated by gas vented from leaks in pipelines and 
          compressors. These would be ignited by sparks or embers from existing 
          bushfires and cause significant damage to fossil fuel infrastructure.
  
        Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for oil and gas 
        through a decrease in spending power of economic agents. 
        
        The decarbonisation ambition of some nations induces transition risks from a 
        High Physical and Transition Risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario. In particular, 
        a decline in fossil fuel demand is induced, with a 30% decline in fossil energy 
        supply in 2050 relative to 2025, and the relative share fossils fuels provide 
        to the global energy supply going from ~83% in 2025 to ~58% in 2050. Whilst 
        these effects are relatively muted compared to the Orderly and Disorderly 
        Transition scenarios, the following financial impacts could still potentially 
        arise for companies:
  
        - Regional divergence in demand for different forms of energy, resulting in 
          regional divergence in revenues. In decarbonising or service-based economies, 
          oil and gas fuel demand is projected to decline, resulting in a reduction in 
          revenue. In fossil-dependent companies, fossil energy demand is expected to 
          remain stable or grow in short to medium terms. This regional divergence will 
          lead to knock-on impacts as capital is reallocated and different firms are 
          advantaged or disadvantaged.
  
        - Overall, oil and gas demand is expected to decline globally in too-little-too-late
          scenarios. As such, reduced revenue due to decline in fossil fuel demand as energy 
          demand is electrified or pushed to low-carbon alternatives. This is especially apparent 
          in road transportation, heating, and power, but other energy-intensive sectors are 
          also at risk of switching. This would have an impact on the business models of c
          ompanies both within the Oil and Gas industry, and those service providers with 
          Oil and Gas businesses as part of their clientele.

        - **Increase in regulatory costs**: this could occur from paying a price on 
          carbon emissions via tax or cap & trade clearing programs. Fragmented and 
          uncoordinated policy is likely to increase the regulatory burden of 
          compliance and thus the costs involved for transnational firms, whilst 
          national oil companies and state-owned or partially state-owned entities 
          will not necessarily face the same concerns.
  
        - **Increased costs of goods sold**: this may occur as carbon prices 
          (both real and effective) affect operational costs, and demand drops, 
          there could be an increase in the business costs for supplying fossil 
          energy. This could partially increase revenues due to increased cost-pass 
          through, but hurts the profitability of the Oil and Gas companies. As 
          the operating conditions vary across regions, this increase in the cost 
          of fossil extraction will be different between different regions, with 
          high-carbon economies maintaining low costs of production in regions 
          such as petrostates with significant reserves or political involvement 
          in fossil industries.
  
        - **Increases in capital expenditures**: this may be required with new 
          investments required to pivot business models towards low carbon energy 
          production, renewable biofuels/hydrogen/synthetic and/or Carbon Capture, 
          Usage and Storage (CCUS), in regions where there is a demand for 
          low-carbon energy alternatives, and it is viable for Oil and Gas firms 
          to fill this role over existing incumbents.
  
        - **Falling asset values**: this could occur as oil and gas reserves and 
          infrastructure required for extraction based on re-adjusted market 
          expectations of a lower demand of fossil fuels in the future, with 
          risks of stranding assets that cannot be retrofitted, repurposed, or 
          whose cost of extraction cannot be reduced to improve profitability 
          and capture the dwindling demand for fossil energy. Asset devaluation 
          would be different across regions, with some assets becoming unviable 
          for reasons of policy and the jurisdiction it falls under as opposed to 
          global market dynamics.
        
        In the Too-little-too-late scenario, primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price 
        at the global market) for oil and gas rise above 2020 levels, albeit inconsistently 
        for both Gas and Oil. Whilst increased costs and cost pass-through is responsible 
        for a small portion of this, especially after 2030 when certain jurisdictions 
        enact some decarbonisation policy, the primary driver is the substitution of 
        overall demand. Primary energy demand for both oil and gas are likely to decrease 
        as it is replaced on purely economic grounds by renewables in power generation, 
        and electrification of demand in heating and transportation.

        Reductions in overall demand starts with the sectors where oil and gas are 
        most substitutable for alternatives. The remaining consumers of oil and gas are 
        those sectors such as shipping and aviation - hard-to-abate sectors that lack 
        significant substitutions in energy supply. The lack of optionality the remaining 
        consumers have decreases the price elasticity of oil and gas. As oil and gas become 
        more inelastic commodities for this reduced set of consumers of fossil fuels, the 
        pricing power of Oil and Gas firms goes up, and the price charged for the dwindling 
        demand of fossil fuels increases. The role of competition is not modelled within 
        traditional Integrated Assessment Models such as NGFS, and thus the real-world price 
        dynamics are harder to predict as any reduction of demand scenario leads to an overall 
        oversupply, and price competition between Oil and Gas firms would drive the prices down.
        
        Oil and Gas assets are mostly limited by geographical constraints due to the location of 
        reserves, and thus the risks above cannot be averted by relocation of supply. Some actions 
        remain to mitigate the physical risks however, namely investing in the weatherisation of 
        offshore rigs, improved drainage systems, and better storm-resilient equipment. Terminals 
        must remain on costs and thus are exposed to rising sea levels and storm surges, but 
        refineries are capable of being relocated to consider climate change risks, especially 
        those caused by flooding.
        
        In mitigating the transition risks, there is no single adaptation strategy that can be 
        adopted, but a range of possible strategies exist based on the circumstances each company 
        faces in the High Physical and Transition Risk scenario, that minimise the long-term 
        financial risks. Examples include “Managed Decline” where a business winds down the business 
        operations in a planned manner in keeping with their fiduciary duties to shareholders or 
        transitioning the business model from a traditional Oil and Gas company to an “Integrated 
        Energy” company by switching to supplying renewable energy, among others.
