    The **casualty** underwriting class is a broad insurance category that protects individuals, employers, and businesses against loss of property, damage and various other liabilities.  This typically encompasses motor underwriting, liability coverage and protection against theft. In this section, motor underwriting, life protection and health are out of scope as they are covered separately or in other classes. As climate change leads to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, liability risks for insurance firms are expected to rise. Parties suffering loss and damage due to climate-related incidents may seek to recover their losses from those they believe are responsible. Successful claims could result in those parties passing on some or all of the costs to insurance firms under third-party liability contracts, such as professional indemnity or directors’ and officers’ insurance. This means that casualty insurers are directly impacted by third-party claims arising from climate litigation, as well as indirectly affected through claims related to property damage or bodily injury caused by extreme weather events. Recent regulatory developments emphasize the importance of understanding and managing these climate-related liability risks (e.g. [PRA Climate Change Adaptation report 2025](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2025/january/pra-climate-change-adaptation-report-2025).

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, the failure to consider, mitigate or adapt to climate change-related risk factors (if insured parties have not sufficiently accounted for climate change risk factors in their acts, omissions or decision-making) could become the subject of shareholder actions against corporations and their directors for breaches of statutory or fiduciary duties or for loss of share value, particularly as fossil fuel assets face devaluation. Additionally, some business sectors may contract during this transition, resulting in reduced the top-line premium income; while others may see growth.

        Climate change risk management is a critical board-level governance issue. Directors must actively engage in establishing and monitoring strategies to mitigate wide-ranging climate-related carbon asset risk relevant for corporate performance. The failure to consider, mitigate or adapt to climate change-related risk factors (if insured parties have not sufficiently accounted for climate change risk factors in their acts, omissions or decision-making) could become the subject of shareholder actions against corporations and their directors for breaches of statutory or fiduciary duties or for loss of share value, particularly as fossil fuel assets face devaluation.
        
        While transitioning away from carbon-intensive businesses may present some challenges, it also opens opportunities through technological innovations and commercialisation in areas such as carbon capture and storage, renewable energy generation and electrification of transportation. Companies advancing these initiatives may require similar insurance coverages as traditional carbon-intensive sectors, presenting potential underwriting and investment opportunities. However, some business sectors may contract during this transition, resulting in reduced premium income, while other sectors may see growth for new companies to fill the market gaps.
        
        Exposures to carbon-intensive industries are likely to be significantly affected, leading to potential market shrinkage and substantial losses through the transition, as stakeholders continue to take legal action against Directors.

        In the Delayed transition scenario, immediate policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, carbon and other legislation could drive a tumultuous transition to a lower carbon economy. The delayed response to energy generation changes, may , result in CO2 emissions increasing until 2035 before rapidly decreasing after 2035 to compensate for the inaction beforehand. 
        
        From a policy perspective, actions to reduce carbon emissions could significantly alter the scope and the pricing of Casualty policies. The following examples illustrate the impacts: 
        
        -	**Product liability:** public policies aimed at curbing carbon emissions and pressures for innovation may lead to challenges in regulatory compliance, with potential disruption in supply chain, the liability claims for product liability may increase. 
       
        -	**Workplace Compensation:** New regulations, additional injury risks from new technologies, and economic pressures can impact compensation claims.
       
        -	**Professional Indemnity:** Higher claims costs, more complex claims due to new technologies being used, and increased liability due to regulatory compliance issues.
       
        -	There also are risks that some types of business shrink in size through the transition, reducing the top-line premium income, while other sectors may see growth. 
        
        Additionally, carbon-intensive industries may face widespread repercussions, including litigation on behalf of employees made redundant through the transition, or from shareholders and other stakeholders for mismanagement of firms (where the firms and directors may be liable for failing to act to mitigate the risks of transition). The likelihood of incurring in defence costs in these cases is high, with a broad range of litigation across different topics increasing the chances of unfavourable outcomes.
        
        The graph below shows how consumption and energy costs may change in a transition scenario which could be considered as a starting point for the impacts on demand and costs for companies that fail to adapt to the transition. Negative impacts on GDP and consumption due to increased costs and economic disruptions, there could also be opportunities for growth through investments in resilience and sustainable practices. Insurers will need to adapt their underwriting practices to reflect these changing dynamics, which will in turn have broader implications for the economy and society.

        The sudden shift to a low-carbon economy could lead to wide-ranging changes in the nature and mix of businesses, causing established customers to shrink rapidly while new companies grow to fill the gaps. This, however, creates substantial opportunities for acquiring new customers, although customer retention may be strained. Moreover, Insurers can mitigate the impacts of high transition risks in casualty underwriting by using advanced climate risk assessment tools, ensuring regulatory compliance, integrating big data and AI for better risk evaluation, collaborating with stakeholders, innovating new insurance products, diversifying portfolios, investing in underwriter training, and implementing sustainability metrics for transparent reporting.

        In Orderly transition scenarios, failing to consider, mitigate, or adapt to climate change-related risks could lead to shareholder actions against corporations and their directors for breaches of statutory or fiduciary duties or loss of share value, especially as fossil fuel assets lose value. Additionally, some business sectors may shrink during this transition, resulting in reduced premium income, while others may experience growth.

Defence costs could be incurred regardless of the litigation outcomes. Liability may also arise from failure to disclose or comply when  insured parties have not sufficiently disclosed information relevant to climate change, have done so in a manner that is misleading, or have otherwise not complied with climate change-related legislation or regulation.

        In Orderly transition scenarios, the additional risks for Casualty insurance are fairly low as immediate policy reaction, societal changes, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation facilitate a smooth transition to a lower carbon economy and an immediate and smooth reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 and increase in the carbon price. From a policy perspective, actions to reduce carbon emissions could change the scope and the pricing of Casualty policies. The following examples illustrate the impacts: 
        
        -	**Product liability:** public policies aimed at curbing carbon emissions and pressures for innovation may lead to challenges in regulatory compliance, with potential disruption in supply chain, the liability claims for product liability may increase.

        The graph below shows how GDP, consumption and energy costs may change in a transition scenario, which could be considered as a starting point for the impacts on demand and costs for companies that fail to adapt to the transition. Overall, while additional energy system cost and GDP loss are likely to increase substantially, in the Low Demand scenario, given the behavioural changes and additional levers in end-use sectors (e.g. faster electrification, renewable substitutes), consumption is positively affected with an exponential increase. Negative impacts on GDP and consumption due to increased costs and economic disruptions, there could also be opportunities for growth through investments in resilience and sustainable practices. Insurers will need to adapt their underwriting practices to reflect these changing dynamics, which will in turn have broader implications for the economy and society.

        In high physical risk scenarios, action against insured parties could be for failure to mitigate climate change risks if the insured parties are being held responsible for the physical impacts of climate change, such as through emissions of greenhouse gases.
      always: |
        The casualty underwriting class is exposed to significant physical risks from climate change. Chronic effects, such as raised sea-levels and mean temperatures, along with acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events (e.g. heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding), could lead to increased claims and premiums, impacting the profitability of this underwriting class. However, these risks are fairly low in the high physical risk scenario as small rises in temperatures are unlikely to lead to significant losses. Action against insured parties could be for failure to mitigate climate change risks if the insured parties are being held responsible for the physical impacts of climate change, such as through emissions of greenhouse gases.
        
        As the value of loss and damage arising from climate change grows, litigation risk is also likely to increase. For example, in January 2018, a lawsuit was filed in New York City against five major oil companies, seeking to collect billions of dollars in damages to pay for city’s climate change adaptation efforts(Savage, 2019).
  
      high_materiality: |
        The following examples illustrate how the Casualty underwriting class could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:
        
        -	**Increasing Claims:** under commercial general liability (CGL) policies, insurers typically cover damages such as bodily injury or property damage. Insurers may face a broad variety of liability claims for both personal injury and property damage as a result of climate change.
  
        -	**Outdoor Work Risks: rising temperatures, and increased likelihood of wet-bulb temperature events, could make outdoor work more hazardous and could increase claims for employers and public liability lines, and workers’ compensation claims.
  
        -	**Medical Malpractice:** shifts in disease patterns due to climate change may result in new medical conditions, potentially increasing malpractice claims related to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment.
  
        -	**Severe Weather Events:** increased storm severity, higher water levels, and more intense droughts could result in higher liability claims and more litigation related to insurance coverage. Research may attribute losses to climate change, prompting legal action against firms responsible for historic emissions. Defence costs for such litigation can be substantial, regardless of the result of the claim.
  
        -	**Litigation risk:** if a large verdict is rendered in the climate change litigation, or if the defendants are unsuccessful in summary judgment and opt to settle the claims for significant sums, then there may be a domino effect in which additional litigation is brought against other entities who also allegedly contributed to climate change.
        
        Specific weather events could lead to rapid increases in insured losses. For example, while productivity may decline due to heat stress, litigation against employers for heat stress injuries could arise during extreme heat events if adequate protective measures are not implemented. As shown on the graph, in both of the hot house scenarios, labour productivity is decreasing with the annual change rate reaching -2.7% in Current Policies scenario and -2.5% in NDCs scenario by 2050. On the other hand the land fraction exposed to heatwaves would increase, the annual change rate increased from 2.7% in 2025 to 5.3% in 2050 in Current Policies scenario, and to 4.6% in NDCs scenario.

        For companies with material exposures to carbon-intensive industries, there is significant risk of increasing litigation for historic emissions that have caused property or livelihoods damage. For example, after Hurricane Harvey, lawsuits were filed against oil and gas operators in Houston for property damage linked to petrochemical spills during the storm. The pressure from litigation, regardless of its outcome, has already influenced the regulatory environment. Companies and insurers should consider this changing regulatory landscape and prepare for a potential increase in climate change-related claims. Although many cases are dismissed by courts due to lack of causality or standing, the global trend is pushing legal boundaries, and claimants are bringing novel and creative legal arguments which courts may consider. The following mitigation measures are available for insurers:
  
        -	**Risk Assessment and Modelling:** Utilize advanced risk models to predict and assess the impact of physical risks, such as natural disasters, on underwriting portfolios.
  
        -	**Preventive Measures:** Implement physical mitigation measures, such as reinforcing infrastructure, installing protective coatings on wires, and pruning vegetation near power lines to reduce the risk of events like wildfires.
  
        -	**Emergency Preparedness:** Develop comprehensive emergency preparedness plans.
  
        -	**Insurance Products:** Offer specialised insurance products that cover specific physical risks, such as flood insurance or earthquake insurance, to provide targeted protection.
  
        -	**Reinsurance:** Utilize reinsurance to spread the risk and reduce the financial impact of large-scale physical events.
  
        -	**Stakeholder Collaboration:** Engage with stakeholders, including clients, regulators, and industry bodies, to share best practices and develop innovative solutions for physical risk mitigation.

        In high physical and transition risk scenarios, insured parties may be held accountable for not mitigating climate change risks, such as regarding greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to address these risks could lead to shareholder actions for breaches of duty, particularly as fossil fuel assets decline. Some business sectors may shrink, reducing premium income, while others may grow.

        The casualty underwriting class faces significant physical and transition risks from climate change. Physical risks include chronic effects like rising sea levels and temperature, as well as acute events such as heatwaves and flooding, which can lead to increased claims and premiums, affecting profitability. Insured parties may be held accountable for failing to mitigate these risks, especially regarding greenhouse gas emissions, leading to higher litigation risks as the value of climate-related damages grows.
        
        On the transition risk side, climate change risk management is crucial for corporate governance. Directors must actively manage climate-related risks, as failure to do so could result in shareholder actions for breaches of duty, particularly as fossil fuel assets decline. While moving away from carbon-intensive businesses poses challenges, it also offers opportunities in areas like renewable energy and carbon capture. Companies pursuing these initiatives may require similar insurance as traditional sectors, creating potential underwriting opportunities. However, some sectors may shrink, leading to reduced premium income, while others may grow to fill market gaps, significantly impacting carbon-intensive industries and leading to potential losses as legal actions against directors increase.

        In the fragmented world scenario, the Casualty underwriting class could be impacted by both high physical risks and high transition risks.

        For employers with significant outdoor activity exposure, the high physical risk could lead to increased claims. Weather events may result in rapid increases in insured losses, particularly as heat stress-related injuries lead to litigation against employers who fail to protect their employees adequately. As shown on the graph, land fraction exposed to heatwaves would keep increasing with the annual change rate rising from 2.7% in 2025  to 4.6% in 2050; and the labour productivity due to heat stress would reduce, with the annual reduction rate reaching -2.5% by 2050.
