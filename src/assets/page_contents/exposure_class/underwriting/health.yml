    # Health Underwriting
    
    The **health underwriting ** class covers personal, corporate and small to medium enterprise domestic health insurance 
    predominantly in the UK market. Under the Solvency II definition of insurance lines of business these are reported under 
    Medical Expense and Assistance.
    
    Heath underwriting risk refers to the potential deviation from the actuarial assumptions used for setting 
    insurance premium rates which could lead to premium inadequacy. Heath underwriting risk should therefore 
    consider both the setting of adequate premiums rates (pricing) and the management of claims (claims) for 
    insurance policies.

        Health underwriting exposures could be impacted in the Delayed transition risk scenario, as a reduction in pollution could result for example in a reduction in cancer (especially lung), respiratory diseases, heart attack and stroke. While healthcare spending may reduce, higher claims costs could arise due to the impact of the increased carbon price on the supply chain.
      always: |
        Health underwriting exposures could be impacted by the transition effects related to changes in pollution levels. In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction means that a ‘Business-as-Usual’ approach to decarbonisation occurs between now and 2030, followed by a sharp increase in policy aggression, resulting in carbon prices increasing. In this scenario, disorderly policy action results in increased transition risks.

        It seems reasonable to assume that a general drive towards reducing greenhouse gases could probably be associated with a drive towards cleaner air, and therefore positive outcomes for health. However, it is important to differentiate between the production of greenhouse gases (such as CO<sub>2</sub> and CH4) that lead to warming but do not directly impact health, with the production of pollutants (such as particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen) that are more directly harmful to health. 
        
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, emissions of hazardous pollutants, for example black carbon, volatile organic compounds, and oxides of nitrogen, are projected to decrease. Emission trajectories for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) as can be seen below are also projected to decrease from ~121 Megatons (Mt) of NO2/yr in 2025 to ~39 Mt NO2/yr in 2050.

        Whilst it may be the case that advances in one are correlated with advancements in the other (for example if diesel cars are replaced with electric cars where the marginal electricity is generated from renewable sources), some climate outcomes may achieve one and not the other. For example:
        
        -	If we replace diesel cars with electric cars but continue to rely on fossil fuels to generate the electricity, then this could address the particulates but not the greenhouse effect.
     
        -	If we increase biomass burning this may reduce greenhouse effect but contribute to local particulate pollution.
    
        -	If pollution and greenhouse gases are reduced locally (e.g. in the UK) but without global buy-in, then this could also reduce the correlation.
        
        In the Delayed Transition scenario, there is potential for fewer deaths and a positive outcome for health relating to air pollution. The reduction in pollution could result in a reduction of cancers (especially lung) and respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma, respiratory allergic disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections), but also cardiovascular disease, although we note that this is very much dependent on the fuel mix generating electrical power for the grid. For example, whilst waste-to energy plants have similar particulate outputs to gas-fired power stations, biomass plants such as wood pellet fired facilities, produce significantly more particulates than gas-fired power stations (Hajat et al., 2014).
        
        **GDP growth effect**
        
        GDP growth impacts the ability of individuals and government to spend more on factors that can impact the nation’s health and thus indirectly levels of claims. The specific scenario would depend on how government and society chose to allocate any GDP growth.
        
        The Delayed Transition scenario could lead to a fall in GDP growth. A slower GDP growth would potentially constrain the growth in spending on NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. This would have negative impacts on health underwriting exposure and could result in challenges to the ongoing affordability of health insurance products, which, given their discretionary nature within the UK, may result in decreased market penetration. 
        
        This could be particularly true of corporate health insurance cover, particularly for companies significantly impacted by transition risks, who may look to reduce costs. This may result in changes to product design and the nature of cover provided to try to mitigate these impacts.
        
        **Carbon Tax**
        
        Similarly, government revenue received as carbon tax could impact the ability of governments to spend more on factors that can impact the nation’s health and thus indirectly levels of claims. In the Delayed Transition scenario, global government carbon tax revenues increase in the short to medium term. The specific scenario would depend on how government and society chose to allocate revenue. However, higher revenue would give a bigger pot to potentially support higher spending on the NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. and so it is reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater “on average” if government revenue is greater (without having to specifically predict how spending is allocated by any future government).
        
        **Other transition impacts**
        
        -	**Economic disruption:** Transition policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions can lead to economic disruptions, affecting employment and income levels, which in turn could impact the affordability and demand for health insurance products. For instance, the shift to renewable energy sources may result in job losses in traditional energy sectors like coal mining and coal-fired power plants. Unlike an orderly transition, the creation of new job opportunities in renewable energy industries may be slower and less effective in offsetting these negative impacts. This prolonged economic disruption can lead to reduced household incomes and decreased affordability of health insurance products.
   
        -	**Regulatory changes:** New regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions can increase operational costs for businesses, potentially affecting their ability to offer employee benefits, including health insurance. For example, the implementation of carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems can raise the cost of production for companies in high-emission sectors like manufacturing and transportation. In a delayed transition scenario, businesses may struggle more to invest in greener technologies and processes to comply with these regulations, further increasing operational expenses and potentially leading to cuts in employee benefits.
    
        -	**Health impacts:** Transition policies can lead to changes in occupational health risks, with some industries facing higher risks due to new technologies or processes. For example, the shift to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power introduces new occupational hazards. Workers in the wind energy sector may face risks associated with working at heights and handling heavy equipment, while those in the solar industry may be exposed to hazardous materials used in photovoltaic cells. Additionally, the transition to electric vehicles and battery storage technologies can introduce risks related to the handling and disposal of batteries. These changes in occupational health risks can impact morbidity and mortality rates, influencing the pricing and design of health insurance products.
   
        -	**Health care transition:** In addition, health care sector is a significant global carbon emitter, with large carbon footprints. This sector is likely to be affected by transition activities. This could potentially result in increased costs in the supply chain which ultimately could be passed onto insurers through increased claims costs. The Increased health care costs, due to increasing carbon prices, could equally place a strain on national health services as government spending is stretched. This may result in an increased demand for private health care cover, providing an opportunity for the health underwriting class.
        
        **Impact on pricing or product design**
        
        To the extent that there is an impact on mortality, the Delayed transition risk scenario could have an impact on the pricing of health insurance products, although this is likely to be modest. Insurers can mitigate the impacts of a Delayed transition scenario on health insurance and underwriting by adjusting premiums, redesigning products, implementing risk-based pricing, and investing in preventive health programs. They can form partnerships with governments to share risks, enhance risk assessment, educate policyholders, offer flexible coverage options, provide incentives for healthy behaviours, and ensure regulatory compliance. These actions help insurers stay competitive and adequately cover emerging risks associated with delayed transition policies.

        Health underwriting exposures could be significantly impacted in the Orderly transition scenarios, as a reduction in pollution could result in a reduction for example in cancer (especially lung), respiratory diseases, heart attack and stroke. However, higher claims costs could arise due to an increased carbon price on the supply chain.
      always: |
        Health underwriting exposures could be impacted by the transition effects related to changes in pollution levels. In Orderly transition scenarios, immediate policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation could lead to an immediate and smooth reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050. This would probably be associated with a drive towards cleaner air due to for example, an increase in electric vehicles replacing vehicles with internal combustion engines.
        
        This would cause a reduction in pollution which could in turn result in a reduction in cancer (especially lung), respiratory diseases, heart attack and stroke. These scenarios could also lead to a limited relative reduction in GDP growth. This could result in changes in the rate of growth in healthcare spending. These are likely to have an impact on health insurance products’ pricing, terms and conditions and coverage.
  
      high_materiality: |
        In Orderly transition scenarios, the impact on the health sector and its associated underwriting class could depend on pollution as well as other effects. For example:
        
        **Pollution effect**
        
        It seems reasonable to assume that a general drive towards reducing greenhouse gases could be associated with a drive towards cleaner air, leading to positive health outcomes. However, it is important to differentiate between the production of greenhouse gases (such as CO<sub>2</sub> and CH4) that lead to global warming but do not directly impact health, and pollutants (such as particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen) that are more directly harmful to health.

        -	In Orderly scenarios, emissions of hazardous pollutants, for example black carbon, volatile organic compounds, and oxides of nitrogen, are projected to decrease. 
   
        -	Emission trajectories for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) as can be seen below are also projected to decrease from between 110 to 120 Megatons (Mt) of NO2/yr in 2025 to between 35 to 40 Mt NO2/yr in 2050.

        **Carbon Tax**
        
        In Orderly scenarios, global government carbon tax revenues are projected to increase, at least in the short to medium term. Government revenue impacts the ability of governments to spend more on factors that can impact the nation’s health and thus indirectly levels of claims. The specific scenario would depend on how government and society chose to allocate revenue. However, higher government revenue from carbon tax would give a bigger pot to potentially support higher spending on the NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. and so it is reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater “on average” if government revenue is greater (without having to specifically predict how spending is allocated by any future government). Increased funding for medical research can lead to the development of innovative treatments and therapies, improving patient outcomes and reducing the long-term costs of healthcare.
        
        **Other transition impacts**
        
        -	**Economic disruption:** Transition policies could lead to economic disruptions, affecting employment and income levels, which in turn could impact the affordability and demand for health insurance. For instance, the closure of coal mines and coal-fired power plants as part of a shift to renewable energy can result in job losses for workers in these industries.

        In high physical risk scenarios, climate change is likely to result in increased disruption that could have an impact on the health underwriting class, as morbidity could be affected by both a reduction in healthcare spending as well as an increase in the myriad of health problems due to higher temperatures.
      always: |
        In the high physical risk scenario, climate change is likely to result in increased disruption that could have an impact on health underwriting classes. Chronic gradual impacts (such as higher average temperatures and rises in the spread of vector-borne diseases) and acute effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather events (such as floods, droughts, bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could promote the development of diseases and the worsening of illnesses, and impact population health. 
        
        Although this could also result in increased claims for those health conditions affected. As health insurance products are generally annually renewable products these impacts can be factored into pricing as they emerge. This could also influence product design and the nature of conditions covered under health insurance contracts. Increased costs and frequency of medical conditions could place a strain on the national health service to the point that private health insurance may become a more attractive proposition or those looking to secure access to treatment. Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed and these vary in line with different temperatures projected.
      high_materiality: |
        **GDP growth effect**
        
        GDP growth impacts the ability of individuals and government to spend more on factors that can impact the nation’s health and thus indirectly levels of mortality and morbidity claims. The specific scenario would depend on how government and society chose to allocate any GDP growth. However, higher GDP would give a bigger pot to potentially support higher spending on the NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. and so it is reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater “on average” if GDP is greater (without having to specifically predict how spending is allocated by any future government). Similarly, a lower GDP would potentially constrain the growth in spending on these areas.
        
        Significant GDP growth reductions could lead to reductions in NHS funding which, assuming that funding is correlated to some extent with morbidity outcomes, would have negative impacts on health underwriting exposure. This could result in challenges to the ongoing affordability of health insurance products, which, given their discretionary nature within the UK, may result in decreased market penetration. This could be particularly true of corporate health insurance cover, particularly for companies significantly impacted by transition risks, who may look to reduce costs. This may result in changes to product design and the nature of cover provided to try to mitigate these impacts.
        
        **Temperature and weather effect**
        
        In a high physical risk scenario, the increases in chronic effects such as temperature variation and weather events could pose significant challenges that could impact the health underwriting class. For example:
        
        -	**Respiratory Disease and Allergies:** there is a direct link between the intensification of climate change and the worsening of existing respiratory diseases. Diseases that raise particular concern include asthma, respiratory allergic disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections.
   
        -	**Cardiovascular disease:** extreme and prolonged heat and air pollution could lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, strokes, heart failure, arrhythmias and cardiac death; High temperatures could result in increased hospitalisations due to cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction.
   
        -	**Mental Health:** mental health consequences of climate change range from minimal stress and distress symptoms to clinical disorders, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and suicide. It is estimated that, globally, as many as half of the people who survive extreme weather events experience adverse mental health outcomes. Anticipating mental health impacts and assessing vulnerable locations and populations is needed to prepare for the climate change impacts on mental health.
  
        -	**Infectious disease:** diseases traditionally associated with tropical and subtropical regions are reaching new areas of the world. Aedes-born virus is anticipated to expand to North America and Europe as the continents become warmer, posing a threat to 49% of the world’s population by 2050. It is expected that temperature-sensitive infectious diseases, could increase by around 20,000 additional cases per year by 2030 in Europe. Permafrost thaw may release unknown bacteria and viruses yet to be tackled by modern medicine.
   
        -	**Dermatology:** extreme weather events could result to an increase in skin infections, inflammatory skin diseases, and traumatic skin disorders.
  
        -	**Elderly populations:** the elderly population are one of the most vulnerable groups to climate change. Both changes in heat and cold exposure elevate elderly risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular deaths, as well as respiratory deaths and morbidity. As climate change is associated with an increase in extreme temperatures and weather events, adaptive strategies for those at highest risk and readiness from health providers is crucial.
   
        -	**Pregnancy, New-born and Children:** extreme heat adversely impacts birth outcomes (length of gestation, birth weight, and stillbirth increase). Studies also present links between various pollutants and the development of autism and asthma in children.
  
        -	**Mortality:** compared with a future without climate change, the World Health Organisation projected excess deaths for the year 2030: 38,000 due to heat exposure in elderly people, 48,000 due to diarrhoea, 60,000 due to malaria, and 95,000 due to childhood undernutrition. These projections highlight the significant health impacts of climate change and the importance of addressing both mitigation and adaptation strategies to protect vulnerable population.
        
        The above risks are likely to result in increased claims for those health conditions affected. These impacts should manifest over a longer time frame and could develop incrementally rather than as one-off events. 
        
        There are several mitigating actions that could be taken against the potential risks, due to physical risks, mentioned above to build resiliency against extreme weather events. For example, integrating climate change into the medical curriculum to better equip health professionals in the face of climate change driven emergencies and extreme weather events. Additionally, insurers can adjust premiums, redesign products, implement risk-based pricing, and invest in preventive health programs. Forming partnerships with governments to share risks, enhancing risk assessment, educating policyholders, offering flexible coverage options, providing incentives for healthy behaviours, and ensuring regulatory compliance are also important strategies. By understanding these dynamics, we can better prepare for the health impacts of climate change and develop strategies to mitigate these risks.

        In the high physical & transition risk scenario, climate change is likely to result in increased disruption that could have an impact on the health underwriting class, as morbidity could be affected by both a reduction in healthcare spending as well as an increase in health problems due to higher temperatures.

        In the high physical & transition risk scenario, climate change is likely to result in an important disruption that could have a significant impact on health underwriting classes. Chronic gradual impacts (such as higher average temperatures and rises in the spread of vector-borne diseases) and acute effects due to changes in the frequency and severity of weather events (such as floods, droughts, bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could promote the development of diseases and the worsening of illnesses, and impact population health. This could also lead to a significant GDP impact which could negatively impact population health. Additionally, transition impacts, such as economic disruptions from the shift to renewable energy and regulatory changes aimed at reducing carbon emissions, could further affect employment, income levels, and occupational health risks.
        
        Although all ages across the world could be impacted, some population groups could be more affected than others, such as children, elderly, and people with chronic diseases. This could result in increased claims for those health conditions affected. 
        
        As health insurance products are generally annually renewable products these impacts can be factored into pricing as they emerge. This could influence product design and the nature of conditions covered under health insurance contracts. Increased costs and frequency of medical conditions could place a strain on the national health service to the point that private health insurance may become a more attractive proposition for those looking to secure access to treatment.
  
      high_materiality: |
        There would also be both high transition and physical risks from a too-little-too-late scenario as a result of the delayed (“too late”) implementation and ultimately diverging in their mitigation stringency, thus rendering the overall efforts insufficient to reach net zero (“too little”). Countries with net zero targets achieve these only partially, while other countries follow current policies leading to increased inequality which would exacerbate regional tensions as well as the physical impacts outlined above.
        
        **GDP growth effect**
        
        GDP growth significantly impacts the ability of individuals and government to spend more on factors that can impact the nation’s health and thus indirectly levels of mortality and morbidity claims. The specific scenario would depend on how governments and societies chose to allocate any GDP growth. However, higher GDP provides a larger pot to potentially support higher spending on the NHS, public health, social care, medical research etc. and so it is reasonable to assume the funding for these areas would be greater “on average” if GDP is greater (without having to specifically predict how spending is allocated by any future government). Similarly, a lower GDP would potentially constrain the growth in spending on these areas, potentially limiting improvements in public health and healthcare services.
        
        Significant GDP growth reductions could lead to reductions in NHS funding which, assuming that funding is correlated to some extent with morbidity outcomes, would have negative impacts on health underwriting exposure. This could result in challenges to the ongoing affordability of health insurance products, which, given their discretionary nature within the UK, may result in decreased market penetration. This could be particularly true of corporate health insurance cover, particularly for companies significantly impacted by transition risks, who may look to reduce costs.

        The above risks are likely to result in increased claims for those health conditions affected. These impacts are likely to manifest over a longer time frame however and could develop incrementally rather than as one-off events.
        
        **Transition impacts**
  
        The transition to a low-carbon economy could also affect health underwriting. For example:
  
        -	**Economic disruption:** transition policies could lead to economic disruptions, affecting employment and income levels, which in turn could impact the affordability and demand for health insurance. For instance, the closure of coal mines and coal-fired power plants as part of a shift to renewable energy can result in job losses for workers in these industries.
   
        -	**Regulatory changes:** new regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions could increase operational costs for businesses, potentially affecting their ability to offer employee benefits, including health insurance. For example, the implementation of carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems can raise the cost of production for companies in high-emission sectors like manufacturing and transportation.
  
        -	**Health impacts:** transition policies could lead to changes in occupational health risks, with some industries facing higher risks due to new technologies or processes. For example, the shift to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power introduces new occupational hazards. Workers in the wind energy sector may face risks associated with working at heights and handling heavy equipment, while those in the solar industry may be exposed to hazardous materials used in photovoltaic cells.
  
        **Impact on pricing or product design**
        
        To address the potential risks from both physical and transition risks, health insurance providers can take several mitigating actions. For example, investing in more resilient solutions for heating/cooling technologies across homes and businesses, as well as integrating climate change into the medical curriculum can better equip health professionals in the face of climate change driven emergencies and extreme weather events and promoting public health initiatives that focus on climate resilience. Additionally, insurers can adjust premiums, redesign products, implement risk-based pricing, and invest in preventive health programs. Forming partnerships with governments to share risk, enhancing risk assessment, educating policyholders, offering flexible coverage options, providing incentives for healthy behaviours, and ensuring regulatory compliance are also important strategies. By understanding these dynamics, insurers create more resilient health insurance products that better protect against the multifaceted impacts of climate change.
