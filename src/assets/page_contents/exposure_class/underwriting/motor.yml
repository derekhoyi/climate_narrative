    # Motor Underwriting 
    
    The **motor** underwriting class involves insuring cars, trucks, motorcycles,
    and other road vehicles. Motor insurance typically covers drivers for third
    party damage caused by their road vehicle such as damage to other vehicles or
    property and injuries to other people, damage to or loss of their road
    vehicle, and injury to the driver themselves. Cover is usually split across
    these separate expenses, with most countries requiring a minimum of
    third-party cover by law.
  
    Motor insurance includes individual policies for private vehicle owners as
    well as fleet policies for companies that operate multiple vehicles as part of
    their business.

        In Delayed transition scenarios, the motor sector and its associated 
        underwriting class could be disrupted by the automotive companies proactively 
        investing in innovation and new technology and changing customer preferences. 
  
      always: |
        In a Delayed transition scenario, late climate policy delays the increase of 
        carbon prices until 2030. Thereafter, implementation of strong climate policies 
        to compensate for prior inaction causes carbon prices to increase sharply. 
        This is likely to have a significant impact on the motor sector and the 
        associated insurance products’ pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage 
        that could generate fast-changing requirements and opportunities. This scenario 
        could also lead to a reduction in GDP growth which could impact the rate of 
        growth in demand for motor insurance.
        
        Policies and regulatory frameworks implemented at regional level rather than 
        international level or evolving at a different speed depending on the region, 
        could result in in an un-level playing field for the motor sector.
        
      high_materiality: |
        In the Delayed transition scenario, there are a number
        of potential impacts on the motor sector and the underwriting class. For
        example:
  
          - **Increased total claims cost:** rising carbon prices could impact 
          the supply chain of vehicles and affect the price of parts, particularly 
          those made of steel or hydrocarbon derived plastics. This could increase 
          claims costs alongside higher costs to operate associated processes such 
          as paint booths or waste disposal. Firms should consider detailed analysis 
          of their claims supply chain to identify the most carbon-intensive areas, 
          which would be most impacted. This could give a more accurate picture of 
          how the Delayed transition scenario impacts the business. 
     
          - **Transition to Electric Vehicles:** in the Delayed transition scenarios, 
          the shift away from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles towards electric 
          vehicles (and possibly hydrogen or other zero-carbon fuel types) is slower and 
          more fragmented. This delay impacts claims, replacement and repair costs, 
          increasing costs of claims in the short to medium term as repair networks 
          adapt to deal with batteries and electric motors instead of internal combustion engines.
     
          - **Changing consumer preferences and revenue:** models of car ownership may 
          change more slowly as the transition to a lower carbon economy is delayed. 
          This could lead to a rise in shared-ownership vehicles (such as zip car) and 
          fewer personal cars. Consequently, the insurance model may shift slowly from 
          issuing policies to individuals to a fleet or business-to-business model, with 
          manufacturers providing the insurance to companies as part of a wider package 
          of services with the vehicle.
     
          - **Impact of new technologies:** although autonomous vehicles are distinct from 
          electric vehicles, many electric vehicles’ manufacturers include autonomous driving features. 
          An increase in the number of electric vehicles is likely to increase the usage of these features, 
          albeit at a slower pace. Firms may need to consider the potential change in insurance products 
          as there could be a shift in accountability for collisions from drivers to manufacturers whilst 
          autonomous driving software is active. Additionally, coverage may expand to include charging 
          cables and chargers owned by the vehicle owner.
  
        In the Delayed transition scenario, Primary energy prices 
        (i.e. the spot price at the global market) could rise above 2020 levels,
        along with secondary energy prices (i.e. paid by large scale consumers)
        as the increased operating costs from paying a price on carbon emissions 
        is partially passed to downstream consumers.

        The motor underwriting class is likely to be impacted by steady 
        decarbonisation in transport. Within both freight and passenger transport, 
        the portion of electric vehicles could increase in Delayed 
        transition scenarios.

        The profitability of the motor sector and its associated underwriting class, 
        in the Delayed transition scenarios, could also depend on the relevant 
        automotive companies proactively investing in innovation and new technology. 
        For example, expansion of affordable low-carbon products and services, and 
        electric vehicle charging networks. These innovations could contribute to an 
        overall decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from road transport. In the Delayed transition 
        scenario, emissions in Mt CO<sub>2</sub> per year falls significantly in passenger vehicles 
        due to the take up of electric vehicles, while freight emissions initially increase 
        up to 2030 to 2035 and then drop slowly afterwards.

        The Delayed transition scenario also presents opportunities for the motor sector. 
        Proactively investing in the above innovations, even at a slower pace, could lead 
        to positive gains in commercial reputation and therefore magnify demand and overall 
        revenue as consumers could proactively seek out businesses with an incorporated green 
        strategy as well as potentially have knock-on impacts for insurance pricing, terms and 
        conditions and coverage.

        In Orderly transition scenarios, the motor sector and its associated 
        underwriting class could be disrupted by the automotive companies 
        proactively investing in innovation and new technology and changing customer 
        preferences.
  
      always: |
        While motor insurance firms could continue to play a role in meeting customer 
        demand for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy generation in 
        Orderly transition risk scenarios, driven by immediate policy reaction, societal 
        change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation, could lead to an 
        immediate and smooth reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050. This would, in turn, 
        leads to an increase in the carbon price and/or policies punishing Internal 
        Combustion Engine vehicles and/or rewarding electric vehicles. The result 
        is a smooth transition away from Internal Combustion Engine vehicles towards 
        electric vehicles (and to a lesser extent hydrogen or other zero-carbon fuel types). 
  
        This transition is likely to impact replacement and repair costs, increasing 
        the costs of claims in the short term as repair networks adapt to deal with 
        batteries and electric motors. Orderly transition scenarios could also lead 
        to a limited relative reduction in GDP growth. This could result in changes 
        in the rate of growth in demand for the motor insurance sector. Additionally, 
        this could impact the profitability of the motor sector, and therefore on 
        the associated insurance products’ pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage.
      
      high_materiality: |
        In Orderly transition scenarios, there are a number of
        potential impacts on the motor sector and the underwriting class. For
        example:
  
        - **Increased total claims cost:** rising carbon prices could impact 
        the supply chain of vehicles and affect the price of parts, particularly 
        those made of steel or hydrocarbon derived plastics. This 
        could increase claims costs alongside higher costs to operate 
        associated processes such as paint booths or waste disposal. Firms 
        should consider detailed analysis of their claims supply chain to 
        identify the most carbon-intensive areas, which would be most impacted. 
        This could give a more accurate picture of how the Orderly transition 
        scenarios impact the business. 
        
        - **Transition to Electric Vehicles:** in the Orderly transition 
        scenarios there is a smooth shift away from Internal Combustion 
        Engine (ICE) vehicles towards electric vehicles (and possibly 
        hydrogen or other zero-carbon fuel types). This has impacts on 
        claims, replacement and repair costs, increasing costs of claims 
        in the short term as repair networks adapt to deal with batteries 
        and electric motors instead of internal combustion engines.
        
        - **Changing consumer preferences and revenue:** models of car 
        ownership may change as the transition to a lower carbon economy 
        encourages more active travel (walking and cycling) and use of 
        public transport. This could lead to a rise in shared-ownership 
        vehicles (such as zip car) and fewer personal cars. Consequently, 
        the insurance model may shift from issuing policies to individuals 
        to a fleet or business-to-business model, with manufacturers 
        providing the insurance to companies as part of a wider package 
        of services with the vehicle.

        are distinct from electric vehicles, many electric vehicles’ 
        manufacturers include autonomous driving features. An increase 
        in the number of electric vehicles is likely to increase the 
        usage of these features. Firms may need to consider the potential 
        change in insurance products as there could be a shift in accountability f
        or collisions from drivers to manufacturers whilst autonomous driving 
        software is active. Additionally, coverage may expand to include 
        charging cables and chargers owned by the vehicle owner.
  
        In general, primary energy prices (i.e. the spot price at the global market) 
        rise above 2020 levels along with secondary energy prices 
        (i.e. paid by large scale consumers) as the increased operating 
        costs from paying a price on carbon emissions is partially passed 
        to downstream consumers.

        The motor sector is exposed to high physical risk scenarios due to the projected 
        increase in weather variation and being subject to increasing disruption. This is 
        likely to have an impact on the profitability of this sector and therefore on the 
        associated insurance products pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage.
        
      always: |
        In high physical risk scenarios, climate change is likely to result in
        increased disruption that could have an impact on the motor sector and its
        underwriting class. Chronic effects (such as raised mean temperature) and
        acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events
        (such as floods, droughts, bushfires and extreme heat and cold) could
        impact frequency and size of the claims. This could result in future
        policyholders becoming more expensive to insure.
        
      high_materiality: |
        In high physical risk scenarios, the increases in chronic and acute climate 
        effects(such as temperature variation and weather events) could pose significant
        challenges that in turn could impact the motor underwriting class. 
        
        The following examples illustrate how the motor underwriting class could be
        impacted in a high physical risk scenario:
  
        - **Higher than average temperatures:** elevated temperatures could impact 
          on global supply chains, with car and part manufacturers price being 
          directly impacted, creating delays and increasing costs of repairs.
        
        - **Extreme weather events:** flooding, cyclones and other extreme 
        weather events can damage infrastructure and vehicles. More frequent and 
        intense events could lead to a larger than anticipated total claims cost. 
        In addition, floods and wildfires, can affect ports, highways, and factories, 
        leading to delays and increased costs in the supply chain.
        
        -	**Regional Variations:** the impact of physical effects could vary by 
        location. For example, in the UK, milder winters may reduce the number of 
        claims related to ice.
  
        Under the high physical risk scenarios, the emissions from passenger 
        vehicles are likely to drop over time, though at a much slower place 
        in the current policies. Freight emissions would increase in current 
        policies while for NDCs, emissions would plateau at 2025 levels.

        Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for vehicles 
        and their associated insurance products through its effect on individuals’ 
        disposable income resulting in a reduction in growth of number of vehicle 
        owners.
        
        Insurers can adapt to high physical risk scenarios by enhancing risk 
        assessment through climate scenario analysis and geospatial data, investing 
        in technology like predictive analytics and AI, strengthening supply chains 
        and repair networks, adjusting policies with dynamic pricing and flexible 
        coverage options (e.g. parametric insurance), collaborating with industry 
        stakeholders, advocating for stronger climate policies, and engaging 
        customers through education and incentives for green practices. These 
        strategies will help manage climate-related risks and ensure the 
        sustainability of the motor underwriting class.

        The motor sector is exposed to high physical and transition risk scenarios 
        due to the projected increase in weather variation and as well as the 
        disorderly transition policiesbeing subject to increasing disruption. 
        This is likely to have an impact on the profitability of this sector and 
        therefore on the associated insurance products pricing, terms and conditions,

        In a high physical & transition risk scenario, climate change is likely 
        to result in increased disruption that could have an impact on the motor 
        sector and its underwriting class. Chronic effects (such as raised mean 
        temperature) and acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity 
        of weather events (such as floods, droughts, bushfires and extreme heat 
        and cold) could impact frequency and size of the claims. This could 
        result in future policyholders becoming more expensive to insure. 
        Additionally, divergent and delayed transition would exacerbate 
        the physical impacts.
        
        Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical and transition risks 
        are assumed and these vary in line with different temperatures 
        projected for each scenario. The too-little-too-late scenario 
        could therefore also lead to a significant GDP impact which 
        could negatively impact demand for motor sector and insurance.
  
      high_materiality: |
        In the too-little-too-late scenario, the motor underwriting sector 
        faces a complex risk landscape due to the combination of high physical 
        risks and disorderly transition policies. Climate action is 
        delayed ("too late") and divergent across regions ("too little"), 
        leading to insufficient mitigation efforts to curb climate change. 
        This results in high physical risks, such as sea level rise, wildfires, 
        and extreme weather events, while transition risks—including abrupt 
        policy shifts and technological adaptation—further complicate underwriting.
        
        Increases in chronic and acute climate effects (such as temperature 
        variation and weather events) could pose significant challenges 
        that in turn could impact the motor underwriting class. The following 
        examples illustrate how the motor underwriting class could be impacted 
        in a high physical risk scenario:
        
       -**Higher than average temperatures:** eElevated temperatures could 
        impact on global supply chains, with car and part manufacturers price 
        being directly impacted, creating delays and increasing costs of repairs.
       
       -**Extreme weather events:** fFlooding, cyclones and other extreme 
        weather events can damage infrastructure and vehicles. More frequent 
        and intense events could lead to a larger than anticipated total claims 
        cost. In addition, floods and wildfires, can affect ports, highways, 
        and factories, leading to delays and increased costs in the supply chain.
       
       -**Regional Variations:** tThe impact of physical effects could vary 
        by location. For example, in the UK, milder winters may reduce the 
        number of claims related to ice.
  
       Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for vehicles 
       and their associated insurance products through its effect on individuals’ 
       disposable income resulting in a reduction in growth of number of vehicle owners.
  
       Under the fragmented world scenario, the emissions from passenger 
       vehicles are likely to drop over time, as electric vehicle take-up 
       would increase significantly particularly in 2035 to 2040. Freight 
       emissions would be largely unchanged. Divergent policies implemented 
       across various regions under this scenario would likely result in 
       regional variation in the adoption of EVs. This could impact insurers 
       operating across multiple countries, requiring them to adopt 
       differentiated approaches for different territories.
