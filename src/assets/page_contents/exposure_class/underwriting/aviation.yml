    # Aviation Underwriting
    
    The **aviation** underwriting class involves insuring companies engaging in economic activity relating to aircrafts. This includes designing, manufacturing, supplying, maintaining and operating both manned and unmanned aircrafts or parts. It also includes activities related to aircraft supporting facilities such as airports and ticket distribution systems.

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, the aviation sector could face increasing operating costs through carbon taxation as well as falling asset values as older and less efficient aircraft could have to be retired earlier than originally planned. This is likely to have an impact on the profitability of this sector and therefore on the associated insurance products pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage.

        The changing patterns in energy generation in the Delayed Transition scenario, driven by late policy action results in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing until 2030 and a decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> after 2030 to compensate for the inaction beforehand, whereas the Divergent scenario results in an immediate but divergent reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Policies and regulatory frameworks implemented at regional level rather than international level or evolving at a different speed depending on the region, could result in an un-level playing field for manufacturers and operators. Both these scenarios are likely to have an impact on the profitability of this sector and therefore on the associated insurance products pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage. These scenarios could also lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This could result in changes in the rate of growth in demand for the aviation sector.
      high_materiality: |
        Changes to carbon emission pricing or taxes and consumer preferences could potentially result in one or more of the following financial impacts: 
  
        - **Increased operating costs:** of underlying aviation companies to be insured could impact their demand for insurance, as lower-performing companies reduce spending on insurance, as a means to cut costs. The significant rise in carbon and energy prices could potentially result in financial impacts, as aviation firms’ carbon emissions face a rising price in the form a carbon tax or cap & trade clearing price, especially for airlines reliant on fossil-based aviation fuels. 
        
          In the Delayed Transition scenario, the price per gigajoule of liquid final energy (liquid fuels from all energy sources; incl. oil products, synthetic fossil fuels from gas and coal, biofuels) for use in transportation increases from ~27 USD in 2025 (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) to ~46 USD in the Delayed Transition scenario, by 2050. This price increase highlights the impact increasing carbon prices has on the final liquid energy price which the aviation sector is dependent on.

        - **Change in regulations covering energy efficiency standards:** this would lead to increasing compliance requirements. Governments may conclude it impossible to decarbonise flying in line with national targets and so limit demand by raising the cost of air travel and limiting airport capacity, which could lead to changes in the level and type of insurance coverage required. 
  
        - **Stranded assets:** under the Delayed transition scenario, aviation companies are faced with increasing possibility of stranded assets. Their existing fleets, particularly older aircrafts, may prove unsuitable for low-carbon retrofits and would face premature write-downs. This could have a knock-on impact on insurers, who would experience a surge in claims from airlines regarding asset impairment.
  
        - **Changing consumer preferences:** these could lead to changes in revenue due to lower customers numbers as a result of change in environmental expectations that could impact this underwriting class. ‘Flight shame’ could also increase along with a modal shift to (high speed) rail, reducing demand for aviation. Slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for aviation through its effect on individuals’ disposable income.

        - **Increased legal risks:** Companies may face increased legal risks, with lawsuits from passengers, environmental groups or governments for failing to meet or make publicly disclosed Net Zero targets or due to emission impacts. Underwriters will need to consider the potential impact of increased litigation risk, particularly in regions with more stringent environmental policies and growing trends of environmental litigation. As regulation is applied regionally in the delayed transition risk scenario, aviation companies may face more regulatory actions or investigations as companies struggle to adapt to the quickly changing regulatory landscape - resulting in an increase in claims to cover legal defence costs. 
        
        - **Investment in decarbonisation technology:** the profitability of the aviation sector and its associated underwriting class, in the Delayed transition scenarios, could also depend on the relevant companies proactively investing in low-carbon retrofits and new assets to decarbonise. For example: airlines could invest in alternative fuel sources (e.g.  Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) such as biofuels and synthetic fuels) in the medium term whilst more complex solutions such as hydrogen and electric aircrafts are being developed in the long term. However, due to the regional application of environmental policy in the Delayed transition scenario (opposed to the international approach in the Orderly transition scenario), challenges around the availability of the required airport infrastructure for new technologies (e.g., SAF and hydrogen refuelling or electric aircraft charging) will hinder international uptake. 
  
          As next generation propulsion technologies are adopted, the value of claims associated with repairs and maintenance may increase for both aircraft assets and airport infrastructure, as well as unknown impacts to claim frequency due to the lack of historic data for modelling. These changes necessitate a revision of underwriting models, as liability coverage may need to be adjusted due to the hazardous nature of hydrogen during storage and transport.
        
          Intelligent routing and smart technologies – which support climate-optimised flying – could contribute to an overall decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the aviation sector, however in the Delayed transition scenario, aviation remains a significantly more carbon-intensive mode of transport compared to alternatives such as road or rail after 2030 due to the lack of policy driven investment of and uptake of low-carbon technologies early in the scenario. In the Delayed Transition scenario, emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> per billion passenger kilometres from aviation passenger transport falls from ~0.08 megatons in 2025 to ~0.06 megatons in 2050 in the Delayed Transition scenario.

        The Delayed transition risk scenario also present opportunities for underwriters to support the decarbonisation of the aviation sector. Underwriters should work closely with manufacturers and regulatory bodies to ensure appropriate underwriting for novel transition assets and encourage clients to implement risk mitigating measures. Opportunities to develop new product offerings should be explored, aiming to address emerging risks faced by the sector (such as coverage of stranded assets) or incentivize sustainable practices (such as premium discounts for airlines and airports that invest in SAF and other low-carbon assets and infrastructure). Having a deep understanding of clients’ transition risks and challenges will enable underwriters to adapt products, pricing, conditions and coverage to changing business models and processes.

        In Orderly transition scenarios, the aviation sector could face increasing operating costs through carbon taxation as well as falling asset values as older and less efficient aircraft could have to be retired earlier than originally planned. This is likely to have an impact on the profitability of this sector and therefore on the associated insurance products pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage.
      always: |
        Changing patterns in energy generation in Orderly transition scenarios, driven by immediate policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon legislation, could lead to an immediate and smooth reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2050 and increase in the carbon price.
        
        This is likely to have an impact on the profitability of the sector, and therefore on the associated insurance products’ pricing, terms and conditions and coverage, and could generate fast-changing requirements and opportunities, as well as potential obstructions, to new product development pathways. These scenarios could also lead to a limited relative reduction in GDP growth. This could result in changes in the rate of growth in demand for the aviation sector.

        Alongside SAF, in the short-term intelligent routing and smart technologies which support climate-optimised flying- could contribute to an overall decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the aviation sector, however aviation will likely remain a more carbon-intensive mode of transport compared to alternatives such as road or rail. This could result in changing consumer behaviour, with lower carbon transport such as rail being favoured over short-haul flights, reducing volume and potentially forcing airlines, manufacturers, leasers and airports to adapt their business model potentially leading to a change in level and type of insurance coverage required. In Orderly transition scenarios, emissions of t CO<sub>2</sub> per billion passenger kilometres from aviation passenger transport falls from ~0.09 megatons in 2025 to between ~0.03 and ~0.05 megatons in 2050.

        In the high physical climate risk scenario, aviation underwriting faces severe disruptions due to intensified weather variations, sea level rise, and droughts, with increased claims frequency, infrastructure damage and operational disruptions. This will require adjustments in pricing, risk selection, and reserves.
      always: |
        TThe aviation sector and its associated underwriting class are exposed to physical risk exacerbated by rising global temperatures. Under both Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Current Policies high physical climate risk scenarios, aviation underwriting faces severe disruptions due to escalating climate impacts. Chronic risks, such as sea level rise, could lead to unrecoverable damage as airports are at increasing risk of coastal flooding and routes disruptions, creating new opportunities and challenges for underwriters. Acute risks, including high severity heatwaves, cyclones, and floods will result in higher claims frequency and increased infrastructure damage, requiring significant adjustments to pricing models, reserves, and risk selection.
  
        As global infrastructure – including over 1,200 airports identified to be in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone – faces increasing pressure from physical risk, adaptation costs will likely be passed across the supply chain. Regional airports, particularly the major airports which are already at risk of coastal flooding, will bear the consequences of the disruptions, creating additional underwriting challenges. In turn, the need for resilience investments will increase demand for specialised insurance products. However, across both scenarios, the impacts of chronic physical risk could lead to a -11.78% (NDCs), and -14.76% (Current Policies) reduction in GDP growth by 2050 as compared to 2017 levels. This could negatively impact demand for aviation products and services with knock-on impacts for sector’s insurance needs. Underwriters will need to adapt swiftly to these changes, recalibrating their models to account for the shifting global landscape of climate risk and the new opportunities arising from this transformation.
  
      high_materiality: |
        In the high physical climate risk scenario, the aviation underwriting sector is exposed severe and frequent climate-related disruptions. The term "high physical risk" refers to the extreme impacts of climate change, where physical risks—both chronic and acute—become far more severe, potentially rendering some risks uninsurable. These disruptions will require substantial adjustments in underwriting practices, including pricing models, risk selection, and reserving to reflect the escalating severity and frequency of climate events.
        
        The following examples illustrate how the aviation underwriting class  could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:
  
  
        - **Higher average temperatures** reduces air density, diminishing lift and consequently lowering the  regulated take-off weight. This reduction necessitates  lower passenger and cargo loads, lowering the revenue passenger kilometre (‘RPK’) of an airline. To compensate for reduced lift, aircrafts may need to use more fuel during take-off and climb, which could further reduce a flight’s payload and increase operating costs. Increased operating and maintenance costs lead to increased business disruptions and more insurance claims. Frequent exposure to extreme weather conditions accelerates wear and tear on aircraft, leading to higher maintenance costs and an increase in claims related to the aircraft hull insurance sub-segment.
  
        - **Intensified sea level rise and flooding:** can degrade runway surfaces, damage infrastructure and ground aircrafts, increasing maintenance costs and giving rise to the claims raised at the back off the aviation property insurance segment as these cover assets related to aviation operations like airports, hangars, and ground support equipment. Moreover, in certain events, for instance when a flooding leads to contamination of surrounding areas, underwriters may experience an increase in claims related to environmental liability insurance.
  
        - **Tropical cyclones:** in both NDCs, and Current Policies scenarios, the expected annual damage from tropical cyclones is projected to increase at an accelerating rate and by 2050 be between 19% and 21% higher compared to 2015 reference period. Coupled with an increased frequency of atmospheric turbulences, storms and heatwaves can increase flight times, affect passenger comfort and safety, damage aircrafts, and induce large scale rerouting or flight cancellations reducing reliability and leading to higher number of claims filed by airlines related to both – crew personnel accident cover caused by increased flight times and increased fatigue from extreme weather, and liability insurance arising from any situations impacting passenger safety.

        With a rise in global temperatures the physical effects of climate change could alter the existence, attractiveness, or viability of some destinations, decreasing demand for some aviation services. For example, demand could decrease for airline routes serving destinations relying on climate conditions for attracting visitors (e.g. snow cover for skiing resorts) or destinations impacted by sea level inundation. This could require the underwriters to reassess the risk profiles of airlines which operate on such routes and result in rising premiums for the most affected airlines. Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for aviation through its effect on individuals’ disposable income, impacting airlines’ financial stability and effectively lead to more conservative underwriting with higher premiumsThere are a number of mitigating actions airlines  can take against the high physical risks  to build resiliency into their operations against both extreme weather events and chronic physical risk impacts. For example, investing in more resilient solutions e.g. continuously review flight plans to ensure optimal routings, standby engineers to reduce technical fault repair time, modernise fleet, and increase flood-mitigating construction standards (e.g., upgrading drainage systems). As such investments help avoid experiencing some of the severe impacts of physical risk and can effectively reduce the number of claims filed to the underwriters. Hence, to boost proactive risk management, underwriters might consider offering various incentives for airlines, such as discounts, which could motivate them to increase their investments even further leading to a positive feedback loop.

        In the Fragmented World scenario, aviation underwriting faces severe disruptions from high physical risks and disorderly transition policies, with delayed climate action and divergent regional mitigation efforts. This results in increased claims frequency, and adjustments to insurance products pricing, terms and conditions, and coverage to account for regional vulnerabilities and adaptation needs.
      always: |
        The aviation sector and its associated underwriting class are exposed to both high physical and transition risks as under the Fragmented World scenario, climate policy response is delayed and divergent among countries globally. The scenario is associated with significantly increasing global temperatures, leading to heightened losses from physical risk, particularly chronic ones. While the acute impacts of physical risk (e.g., changes to frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, cyclones, droughts and flooding) remain pressing concerns, the chronic impacts (e.g., raised sea-levels, increasing mean temperatures, and extreme daily rainfalls) significantly increase. These impacts could negatively affect aircraft performance, cause re-routings and temporary closure of airspace and airports as well as damage to infrastructure and aircraft with negative effects on costs and earnings and an increase in insurance claims across sub-segments of the aviation underwriting class. Moreover, the lack of relevant policies and regulations across certain regions, and delay in their applications in regions with net zero commitments, result in sharp increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions until 2040 and a decrease of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions thereafter as a result of stricter regulations in regions with net zero commitments post 2030. As policies and regulatory frameworks are integrated at regional levels and are limited only to certain geographies, it could result in an un-level playing field for manufacturers and operators. This could lead to an increased legal and liability climate risks for underwriters, particularly in regions with stringent environmental laws. 
        
        Whilst the aviation sector is used to responding to and managing changing weather conditions, in the high physical risk scenario, climate change and global warming, in particular chronic physical risk, likely result in amplifying weather variability. This could lead to increasing disruption to aviation sector which coupled with the uneven impacts of transition policies based on companies’ operating regions, could impact the profitability for these companies. As a result, the physical and transition risk effects of climate change could impact the aviation underwriting class due to increased claims and increased premiums potentially resulting in some of the aviation underwriting risks becoming either uninsurable or unaffordable. The impacts of chronic physical risk, and transition risk could lead to a -12.88%, and -0.74% reduction in GDP growth by 2050 respectively (as compared to 2017 levels). This could negatively impact demand for aviation products and services with knock-on impacts for sector’s insurance needs.
  
      high_materiality: |
        The following examples illustrate how the aviation sector could be impacted in a high physical and transition risk scenario:
        
         - **Higher average temperature:** reduces air density, diminishing lift and consequently lowering the regulated take-off weight. This reduction necessitates lower passenger and cargo loads, lowering the revenue passenger kilometre (‘RPK’) of an airline. To compensate for reducted lift, aircrafts may need to use more fuel during take-off and climb, which could further reduce a flight’s payload and increase operating costs.. Frequent exposure to extreme weather conditions accelerates wear and tear on aircraft, leading to higher maintenance costs and an increase in claims related to the aircraft hull insurance sub-segment.

Coupled with an increased frequency of atmospheric turbulences, storms and heatwaves can increase flight times, affect passenger comfort and safety, damage aircraft, and induce large scale rerouting or flight cancellations reducing reliability and leading to a higher number of business interruption claims filed by airlines related to both – crew personnel accident cover caused by increased flight times and increased fatigue from extreme weather, and liability insurance arising from any situations impacting passenger safety.

         From a physical risk perspective, with a rise in global temperatures the physical effects of climate change could alter the existence, attractiveness, or viability of some destinations, decreasing demand for some aviation services. For example, demand could decrease for airline routes serving destinations relying on climate conditions for attracting visitors (e.g. snow cover for skiing resorts) or destinations impacted by sea level inundation.

Significantly slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for aviation through its effect on individuals’ disposable income, impacting airlines’ financial stability and effectively lead to more conservative underwriting with higher premiums.
        
         There are a number of mitigating actions airlines can take against the high physical risks mentioned above to build resiliency into their operations against both extreme weather events and chronic physical risk impacts. For example, investing in more resilient solutions e.g. continuously review flight plans to ensure optimal routings, standby engineers to reduce technical fault repair time, modernise fleet, and increase flood-mitigating construction standards (e.g., upgrading drainage systems). As such investments help avoid experiencing some of the severe impacts of physical risk, it can effectively reduce the number of claims filed to the underwriters. Hence, to boost proactive risk management, underwriters might offer various incentives for airlines, such as discounts, which could motivate them to increase their investments even further leading to a positive feedback loop.
        
         From a transition risk perspective, changes to carbon emission pricing or taxes and consumer preferences could potentially result in one or more of the following financial impacts:
        
         - **Increased operating costs:** of the underlying companies to be insured could impact their demand for insurance with some lower-performing companies reducing spending on insurance as a means to cut costs. The rise in carbon and energy prices could potentially result in financial impacts, as aviation firms’ carbon emissions face a rising price in the form a carbon tax or cap & trade clearing price, especially for airlines reliant on fossil-based aviation fuels that need to remain compliant with the climate policy response in countries with net zero targets. In the Fragmented World scenario, the price per gigajoule of liquid final energy (liquid fuels from all energy sources; incl. oil products, synthetic fossil fuels from gas and coal, biofuels) for use in transportation increases from ~27 USD/GJ in 2025(inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) to ~35 USD/GJ by 2050. This price increase highlights the impact increasing carbon price has on the final liquid energy price which the aviation sector is dependent on.

         - **Change in regulations covering energy efficiency standards:** this would lead to increasing compliance requirements. Governments of countries with net zero targets may conclude it impossible to decarbonise flying in line with national targets and so limit demand by raising the cost of air travel and limiting airport capacity, which could lead to changes in the level and type of insurance coverage required. In the Fragmented World scenario, a regional divergence in risk is present. In high transition risk advanced economies, strong climate policies lead to surge in claims and higher premiums. In emerging economies risk-levels stay stable while premiums remain not impacted.
        
         - **Stranded assets:** aviation companies are faced with the increasing possibility of stranded assets. Their existing fleets, particularly older aircrafts, may prove unsuitable for low-carbon retrofits and would face premature write-downs. This could have a knock-on impact on insurers, who would experience a surge in claims from airlines regarding asset impairment especially across the high transition risk advanced economies. 
        
         - **Changing consumer preferences:** could lead to changes in revenue due to lower customers numbers as a result of change in environmental expectations that could impact this underwriting class. ‘Flight shame’ could also increase along with a modal shift to (high speed) rail, reducing demand for aviation. Slowed GDP growth could further impact demand for aviation through its effect on individuals’ disposable income, impacting airlines’ financial stability and effectively leading to more conservative underwriting with higher premiums.
        
         - **Increased legal risks:** companies may face increased legal risks, with lawsuits from passengers, environmental groups or governments for failing to meet or make publicly disclosed targets or due to emission impacts. Underwriters will need to consider the potential impact of increased litigation risk in regions with more stringent environmental policies and growing trends of environmental litigation. As regulation is applied regionally in the Fragmented World scenario, aviation companies may face more regulatory actions or investigations as companies struggle to adapt to the regulatory landscape across the high transition risk advanced economies - resulting in an increase in claims to cover legal defence costs.
        
         - **Investment in decarbonisation technology:** the profitability of the aviation sector and its associated underwriting class could also depend on the relevant companies proactively investing in low-carbon retrofits and new assets to decarbonise. For example: airlines could invest in alternative fuel sources (e.g., Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) such as biofuels and synthetic fuels) in the medium term whilst more complex solutions such as hydrogen and electric aircraft are being developed in the long term. However, due to the regional differentiation in application of environmental policy challenges around the availability of the required airport infrastructure for new technologies (e.g., SAF and hydrogen refuelling or electric aircraft charging) can again result in an increase in claims to cover legal defence costs as companies might be failing to meet some of the targets set by the high transition risk advanced economies.
        
         As next generation propulsion technologies are adopted, the value of claims associated with repairs and maintenance may increase for both aircraft assets and airport infrastructure, as well as unknown impacts to claim frequency due to the lack of historic data for modelling. These changes necessitate a revision of underwriting models, as liability coverage may need to be adjusted due to the hazardous nature of hydrogen during storage and transport.

         Intelligent routing and smart technologies which support climate-optimised flying  could contribute to an overall decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the aviation sector, however aviation will likely remain a more carbon-intensive mode of transport compared to alternatives such as road or rail. In the Fragmented World  scenario, emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> per billion passenger kilometres from aviation passenger transport falls from ~0.08 megatons in 2025 to ~0.06 megatons in 2050 in the Fragmented World Scenario.

         The Fragmented World scenario also presents opportunities for underwriters to support the decarbonisation of the aviation sector. Proactively investing in the above innovations could lead to positive gains in commercial reputation and therefore magnify demand and overall revenue as consumers could proactively seek out businesses with an incorporated green strategy. Therefore, as such, those additional investments can help avoid experiencing some of the impacts of high transition risk in advanced economies and can reduce the number of claims filed to the underwriters especially related to environmental liability. Hence, to boost proactive risk management, underwriters might consider offering various incentives for airlines, such as premium discounts for airlines and airports that invest in SAF and other low-carbon assets and infrastructure, which could motivate them to increase their investments even further leading to a positive feedback loop.
        
         Underwriters should work closely with manufacturers and regulatory bodies to ensure appropriate underwriting for novel transition assets and encourage clients to implement risk mitigating measures. Opportunities to develop new product offerings should be explored, aiming to address emerging risks faced by the sector (such as coverage of stranded assets). Having a deep understanding of clients’ transition risks and challenges will enable underwriters to adapt products, pricing, conditions and coverage to changing business models and processes.
