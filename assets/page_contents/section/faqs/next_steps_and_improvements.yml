   question: Will the tool be updated in the future? 
   answer: |
        The Climate Financial Risk Forum Scenario Analysis Working Group will update the tool periodically to enhance content, 
        including to reflect future updates to NGFS scenarios. In the next iteration of the tool, the CFRF Scenario Analysis Working 
        Group intends to further integrate the NGFS short-term scenario datasets, providing sector-level narratives where relevant and 
        impact metrics for both transition and physical risks. For more information, please refer to [Purpose: What is next?](purpose/what-is-next).
