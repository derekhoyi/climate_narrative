    **Use and Purpose**
    1.	What is the purpose of the tool? 

    This online climate scenario analysis tool is designed to support financial services firms in assessing their climate-related 
    risks and opportunities. The tool summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for banks, insurers and 
    asset managers based on the business activities, products, or risks of the firm and the materiality of different lending 
    exposure types, underwriting classes, asset classes, and economic sectors for the firm. For more information, please refer to 
    [link to Purpose: overview]

    2.	How can the reports generated by the tool be used?

    The information provided by the online climate scenario analysis tool and its associated reports aims to help financial 
    services firms better understand their potential financial exposures to climate change. This information could help them to 
    start considering climate-related risks and opportunities within their governance, strategy, risk management and reporting 
    under the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures’ (TCFD) recommendations or support their climate transition 
    plans. For more information, please refer to [link to Purpose: How can the reports be used?]

    3.	What audience is the tool targeted for? 

    The online climate scenario analysis tool is targeted to support financial services firms in assessing their climate-related 
    risks and opportunities, using scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) as a base. These 
    scenarios were primarily developed for central banks and supervisors, but they provide a useful reference point for other 
    financial institutions, including banks, asset managers and insurers, when evaluating the impacts of climate-related risk to 
    their business.

    4.	What limitations should I be aware of when using the tool?

    There are a number of uncertainties and limitations associated with the tool. The tool is based on NGFS Phase V long-term 
    scenarios (November 2024) and only signposts to NGFS short-term scenarios (May 2025). The scenarios underpinned by this tool 
    are not forecasts but rather plausible pathways designed to help financial institutions explore the potential range of 
    outcomes and build resilience. For more information on limitations of the long-term scenarios narratives, please refer to 
    [link to Limitations: long-term scenario], while for limitations of the short-term scenarios narratives, please refer to [link 
    to Limitations: short-term scenario]

    **Sector and Scenario coverage**

    5.	What sectors are covered by the tool?

    The tool covers a total of 33 sectors, 11 of which are individual sovereign exposures. For more information, please refer to 
    [link to: Sectors] 
    
    6.	What scenarios are covered by the tool? 

    The tool covers 7 long-term scenarios based on NGFS fifth vintage (Phase V), published in November 2024. For more information, 
    please refer to [link to Scenarios: long-term scenarios]

    In addition, the tool signposts to 4 NGFS short-term scenarios that captures five years of transition or physical risk 
    dynamics, published in May 2025. For more information, please refer to [link to Scenarios: short-term scenarios]

    **Reports**
    7.	Am I able to generate reports tailored to my institution? 

    Yes, selecting the ‘Institutional Report’ will enable you to tailor reports to your business activities, products, and
    materiality of exposures to an asset class, sector, or liability class. For more information, please refer to [link to 
    Reports: Institutional Report] 

    8.	Am I able to generate reports that contain a description of the scenarios only?

    Yes, selecting the ‘Scenario Report’ will enable you to select scenarios for which you would like the report to be generated 
    for. These reports contain a high level overview of the scenario(s) with no detail relating to different asset classes, 
    sectors or liabilities. For more information, please refer to [link to Reports: Scenario Report]

    9.	Am I able to produce reports for all sectors and all scenarios?

    Yes, selecting the ‘Full Report’ will enable take you straight to the report containing all sectors and scenarios. For more 
    information, please refer to [link to Reports: Full Report]

    10.	What reports are available from the tool? 

    There are four types of reports that the tool can generate: Institutional Reports, Sector Reports, Scenario Reports and the 
    Full Report. Please refer to [link to Reports: Generate Report] and follow the links to understand the contents under each 
    type of report. These reports are available for download in Microsoft Word format. 

    **Variable charting**

    11.	How are the indicators split for charting? 

    The indicators for charting are split by the physical risk and the transition risk categories. E.g., economic damages from 
    flood are captured under ‘physical risk’; carbon price is captured under ‘transition risk’. GDP is a unique case that is 
    captured under ‘transition risk’ however is reported for both the impacts combined, by transition and by physical (chronic) 
    risk (see separate FAQ question on GDP impacts). The variable charting tool acts as a filter, beginning with the selection of 
    either physical or transition risk, therefore if variables are subsequently unavailable, this implies that datapoint for that 
    selection is not present in the underlying dataset.
    
    12.	What regions are represented within the datasets for variable charting?

    Data for UK is only available for physical risk variables. World and other granular countries are available for transition 
    risk variables (namely for the sovereign countries within the tool). Region is the secondary filter, i.e., where indicators 
    are not available for specific countries, this implies that the country data for that selection is not present. 

    13.	Where can I find GDP impacts? 

    GDP impacts are captured under ‘transition risk’ and can be further broken down into: 
    a) combined – combined transition and physical risk impacts (including business confidence shocks for the Disorderly scenario)
    b) combined (no bus) – combined transition and physical risk impacts, not including business confidence shocks, available for 
    the Disorderly scenario only
    c) transition – transition risk impacts only
    d) physical – physical (chronic) risk impacts only  

    GDP impacts is not available for the Low Demand scenario, and GDP transition risk impacts are not available for the Current 
    Policies scenario as there is only physical risk impacts.

    14.	Where can I find other macroeconomic outputs?

    Other macroeconomic indicators such as inflation are also available under ‘transition risk’ and are is similarly broken down 
    into:   
    a) combined – combined transition and physical risk impacts (including business confidence shocks for the Disorderly scenario)
    b) combined (no bus) – combined transition and physical risk impacts, not including business confidence shocks, available for 
    the Disorderly scenario only
    c) transition – transition risk impacts only
    d) physical – physical (chronic) risk impacts only  

    **Next steps and improvements** 

    15.	How do I provide feedback or highlight areas to improve in the tool?

    Please provide feedback via the buttons in the footer [link to: Feedback]

    16.	Will the tool be updated in the future? 

    The Climate Financial Risk Forum Scenario Analysis Working Group will update the tool periodically to enhance content, 
    including to reflect future updates to NGFS scenarios. In the next iteration of the tool, the CFRF Scenario Analysis Working 
    Group intends to further integrate the NGFS short-term scenario datasets, providing sector-level narratives where relevant and 
    impact metrics for both transition and physical risks. For more information, please refer to [link to Purpose: What is next?]
