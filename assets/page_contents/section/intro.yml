  ### How can the report be used?

  The information provided by the CFRF Online Scenario Analysis Narrative Tool and its associated reports aims 
  to help firms better understand their potential financial exposures to climate change. This information could help 
  them to start considering climate-related risks and opportunities within their governance, strategy, risk management and 
  reporting under the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures’ (TCFD) recommendations or support their climate transition plans. 
  The information provided could also encourage a more in-depth scenario analysis exercise to better understand the associated impact and 
  support decision making. However, the observations in this report do not constitute financial 
  or other professional advice and should not be relied upon as such.

  ## Limitations

  The NGFS Phase 5 scenarios have several limitations that should be carefully considered, for example:

    - The scenarios rely on simplified assumptions about future policies, technologies, and economic developments, 
    which do not fully capture the complexities of real-world transitions as well as the complex interconnectivity of risks. 
    For example, there is limited consideration of incentives to lower solely non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (e.g., methane) which would be 
    pertinent levers for sectors such as livestock farming and energy; the global transition investment exceeded $2 Trillion for 
    the First Time in 2024 – ahead of NGFS scenarios by 5 years
    - NiGEM, used for understanding the macroeconomic impacts as a response to the different transition pathways, 
    is a Single-Agent General Equilibrium Model. These models excel in understanding the wider macroeconomic response, 
    but are not designed to model intra-group competition, inequalities, or variation, and extra caution is advised in 
    examining individual companies or sovereigns modelled within a group.
    - Sovereigns are split in their modelling between “Full Country” economic models, “Reduced Country Models”, and 
    “Regional Block” models. As such, certain nations (including Brazil and India) are modelled at the reduced level 
    (they lack a modelled government sector that must strike any balance between tax revenues and spending, and use a 
    simplified model for primary energy production).
    - They do not fully account for physical impacts, including tipping points and compound risks. 
    For example, certain relevant and material acute physical risks are not comprehensively modelled as only four acute physical 
    impacts are modelled using one transmission channel (flood and cyclones through capital asset damages; droughts through crop 
    yield losses; heatwaves through labour productivity decline.
    - The societal impacts, such as climate-induced migration, are not thoroughly considered and are assumed to be the same across these scenarios.
    - The Orderly Below 2&deg;C scenario generates a common carbon price for the global power and transportation sectors. Whereas in the 
    Net Zero 2050 scenario there are regional differences in carbon price, and in the Fragmented World scenario there are sectoral differences
    in carbon price, as well as between, say EU and US and China.
    - There is significant uncertainty about future technology developments and government policy changes, which can affect the accuracy of the scenarios.
    - The climate scenarios focus on the most likely outcomes rather than the tail events where there is an 18% change of equilibrium climate sensitivity 
    being greater than 4.5&deg;C. For further information please see the paper produced by the Institute of Actuaries Climate Scorpion – the sting is 
    in the tail Introducing planetary solvency.


  For the purposes of this report, NiGEM calculated Carbon Prices have been used, with REMIND-MAgPIE inputs. This is as opposed to 
  the REMIND-MAgPIE carbon prices that directly model the energy changes. This was done for consistency across the countries assessed, 
  as the REMIND-MAgPIE model is split into 12 regions and carbon policy modelling is uniform within those regions. Whilst the NiGEM Carbon 
  Prices are not in use by the model, they are indicators of the transition ambition of sovereigns under different climate transition scenarios, 
  and as they are themselves abstractions of climate policy, they are displayed throughout for sovereigns. REMIND-MAgPIE allows for carbon prices 
  to be available for the US, China, India, and Japan, as well as the European Union, without any need for downscaling for these entities.
  
  ### What is next?

  The Climate Financial Risk Forum Scenario Analysis Working Group will update the tool periodically to enhance content, 
  including to reflect future updates to NGFS scenarios
