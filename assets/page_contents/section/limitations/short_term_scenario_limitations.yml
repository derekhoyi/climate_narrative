    The tool provides an indicative crosswalk to the NGFS short-term scenarios (May 2025). This is an analytical aid developed by 
    CFRF members and should not be interpreted as an official NGFS prescription. The tool does not provide granular sector metrics 
    from the short-term scenario datasets. It instead provides guidance on a framework of considerations / questions when analysing 
    the scenarios. 

    To illustrate how the NGFS short-term scenarios could impact financial institutions portfolios, examples are provided for five 
    sectors: Financial Services, Manufacturing, Agriculture, Construction and Energy Underwriting. These examples do not provide a 
    comprehensive overview or analysis of the sector performance; therefore, users are encouraged to consider this in parallel 
    with metrics from the NGFS short-term scenario datasets and consult the NGFS scenario portal and related technical 
    documentation.

    NGFS short- and long-term scenarios should be compared with caution as they explore different narratives and employ different 
    modelling frameworks. There are major differences between the two scenario sets, these include: 
    - **Narrative assumptions**: The two scenario sets contain unique narratives, associated policy storylines and applied shocks. 
    Transition narratives may partly align, but the timing of policy differs. 

    - **Modelling frameworks and transmission channels**: The short- and long-term scenarios are based on different suites of 
    models, each with unique transmission channels. The baseline for the short-term scenarios is calibrated based on the IMFâ€™s 
    October 2023 world Economic Outlook, whilst the Phase V long-term scenarios are calibrated on the SSP2 population and growth
    rate trend, IMF World Economic Outlook and NIESR baseline projections.

    - **Physical risk**: In the short-term scenarios, physical risk is driven by specific acute compound events occurring in 
    selected years and affecting each continent individually, while also accounting for trade and financial linkages. In contrast, 
    the long-term scenarios model annual acute and chronic physical risks at the country level projecting them forward with a 
    probabilistic approach to link them to changes in weather drivers over the longer time horizon. 

    - **Variables**: While many variables are available in both scenario sets, definitions of these variables might differ.
