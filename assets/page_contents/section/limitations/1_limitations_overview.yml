        # overview
        
        There are several uncertainties and limitations associated with the tool. The tool is based on NGFS Phase V long-term 
        scenarios (November 2024) and only signposts to NGFS short-term scenarios (May 2025), covering climate risk impacts only (i.e. 
        other environmental impacts such as nature is not assessed). It is updated periodically to enhance content. The scenarios 
        underpin by this tool are not forecasts but rather plausible pathways designed to help financial institutions explore the 
        potential range of outcomes and build resilience.
