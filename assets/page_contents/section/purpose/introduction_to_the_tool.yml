    # Introduction to the tool

    The Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) Online Scenario Analysis tool content has been developed by a cross-industry working 
    group under the auspices of the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority's CFRF. The tool was 
    developed for banks, asset managers and insurers of all sizes, and may be of interest to other institutions, such as pension 
    schemes, as well as firms with operations outside of the UK. Although, it should be noted some of the data references from the 
    NGFS scenarios are UK specific.

    The tool summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for banks, insurers and asset managers based on the 
    business activities, products, or risks of the firm and the materiality of different lending exposure types, underwriting 
    classes, asset classes, and economic sectors for the firm. The descriptions draw on data from the long-term scenarios 
    developed by the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) in November 2024, while also 
    signposting to NGFS short-term scenarios recently published in May 2025.
