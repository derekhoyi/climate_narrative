    # Purpose overview

    This online climate scenario analysis tool is designed to support firms in assessing their climate-related risks and 
    opportunities. The tool is designed to be fully open source, and the purpose of this document is to record the contents to be 
    used in the tool for different NGFS scenarios, lending exposure types, underwriting classes, asset classes and economic 
    sectors.

    The descriptions of the NGFS long-term scenarios are based on the fifth vintage (Phase V) of the scenarios which were updated 
    and expanded in 2024, including a. new damage function, the latest release i.e., version 3.0 of shared-socio economic pathways 
    (SSPs) and most recent country level commitments announced by March 2024. These were developed to provide a common starting 
    point for the financial sector to assess climate-related risks. 

    In addition to these long-term pathways, the tool signposts to NGFS short-term scenarios that captures five years of 
    transition or physical risk dynamics. An indicative crosswalk between the short and long-term scenarios is provided, to help 
    users understand for example, how a sudden policy shock or extreme-weather cluster in the short-term scenarios could influence 
    the longer arc described by the traditional scenarios. The mapping table, methodological note and limitations are provided as 
    standalone text that sits outside the reports generated by this tool.

    The scenarios were primarily developed for central banks and supervisors, but they provide a useful reference point for other 
    financial institutions, including banks, asset managers and insurers, when evaluating the impacts of climate-related risk to 
    their business. 

    As well as a description for each lending exposure type, underwriting class, asset class and economic sector the main blocks of
    narrative are used to produce the contents of the report as well as the executive summary for different NGFS scenarios.

    While the tool provides a brief description of the relevant short-term scenarios, it does not host the underlying short-term 
    scenario datasets. Users who wish to explore detailed macro variables, sectoral shocks or regional physical-risk profiles 
    should visit the NGFS scenario portal and select the “Short-Term Scenarios” tab.
