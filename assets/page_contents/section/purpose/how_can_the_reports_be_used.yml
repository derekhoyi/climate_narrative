    # How can the reports be used
    
    The information provided by the CFRF Online Scenario Analysis Narrative Tool and its associated reports aims to help firms 
    better understand their potential financial exposures to climate change. This information could help them to start considering 
    climate-related risks and opportunities within their governance, strategy, risk management and reporting under the Task Force 
    on Climate-Related Financial Disclosuresâ€™ (TCFD) recommendations or support their climate transition plans. The information 
    provided could also encourage a more in-depth scenario analysis exercise to better understand the associated impact and 
    support decision making. However, the observations in this report do not constitute financial or other professional advice and 
    should not be relied upon as such.
