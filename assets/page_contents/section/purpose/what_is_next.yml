    # What is next

    The Climate Financial Risk Forum Scenario Analysis Working Group will update the tool periodically to enhance content, 
    including to reflect future updates to NGFS scenarios. In the next iteration of the tool, the CFRF Scenario Analysis Working 
    Group intends to further integrate the NGFS short-term scenario datasets, providing sector-level narratives where relevant and 
    impact metrics for both transition and physical risks. These short-term narratives will be presented alongside rather than 
    replace the long-term narratives.
