  This online climate scenario analysis tool is designed to support firms
  in assessing their climate-related risks and opportunities.

  ## Purpose

  The Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) Online Scenario Analysis tool content has been 
  developed by a cross-industry working group under the auspices of the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority 
  and Financial Conduct Authority's CFRF. The tool was developed for banks, asset managers and insurers of all sizes, 
  and may be of interest to other institutions, such as pension schemes, as well as firms with operations outside of the UK. 
  Although, it should be noted some of the data references from the NGFS scenarios are UK specific.

  The tool summarises the relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for banks, insurers and 
  asset managers based on the business activities, products, or risks of the firm and the materiality 
  of different lending exposure types, underwriting classes, asset classes, and economic sectors for the firm. 
  The descriptions draw on data from the scenarios developed by the Central Banks and 
  Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) in November 2024. 

  The NGFS scenarios explore a range of transition and physical risks and are defined as follows:


    - **Orderly scenarios** assume climate policies are introduced early and become gradually more stringent. 
       Both physical and transition risks are relatively subdued.
      - **Net Zero 2050** is an ambitious scenario that limits global warming to 1.5°C through stringent 
      climate policies and innovation, reaching global Net Zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions around 2050. This scenario assumes 
      that ambitious climate policies and technological shift are introduced immediately and forcefully impact the economy.
      - **Below 2&deg;C** gradually increases the stringency of climate policies, giving a 67% chance of limiting
      global warming to below 2&deg;C.
      - **Low Demand** is a scenario in which strong energy demand reductions help to limit global warming to 
      below 1.5&deg;C in an orderly fashion. Low Demand stresses the importance of demand-side measures through 
      more ambitious mitigation efforts i.e. behavioural changes reflected in lower energy demand. 
  
  
    - **Disorderly scenarios** higher transition risk due to policies being delayed or divergent across countries or sectors. 
      For example, (shadow) carbon prices are typically higher for a given temperature outcome.
      - **Delayed transition** assumes annual emissions do not decrease until 2030. Strong policies and 
      investments are subsequently needed to limit warming to below 2°C.The level of commitments of countries 
      depend on currently implemented policies, leading to heterogeneity at the global level.

    - **Hot house world scenarios** assume that some climate policies are implemented in some
      jurisdictions, but globally efforts are insufficient to halt significant global warming,
      leading to high physical risk.
      - **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** includes all pledged targets even if not yet backed up by implemented effective policies.
      -	**Current Policies** assumes that only currently implemented policies are preserved, leading to high physical risks.
      Emissions grow leading to about 3&deg;C. Investments allocation and energy mix do not change.

    - **Too-little-too-late scenarios** assume that late and uncoordinated transition fails to limit
      physical risks.
      - **Fragmented World** assumes delayed and divergent policy ambition globally, leading to high physical 
      and transition risks. The Fragmented World scenario explores adverse impacts if we fail to timely implement 
      globally coordinated climate mitigation policies with temperature rising by more than 2&deg;C. 
      Climate policies and corresponding carbon prices vary wildly across geographies and sectors, resulting in 
      high transition risks on top of high physical risks.



  The NGFS scenarios are generated by three Integrated Assessment Models: GCAM 6.0, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM 2.0-M-R12 
  and REMIND-MAgPIE 3.3-4.8 (covering mainly transition risks and using global databases), as well as 
  Climate Impact Explorer developed by Climate Analytics (an online database covering certain physical risk hazards, 
  drawing on country-specific data). The macroeconomic outputs are generated by 
  the National Institute Global Econometric Model (NiGEM) v1.24.2. 

  The NGFS scenarios are further detailed in the [NGFS scenario portal](https://www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal/).
  For full details on the data used to create the graphs and charts shown in the reports
  see [here](https://github.com/JohnAdders/climate_narrative/wiki/NGFS-Scenario-Data-used-in-Charts-and-Graphs).

  The information provided by the tool may encourage some firms to undertake a more in-depth climate
  risk analysis exercise to better understand the associated impact and aid decision making. To
  support these exercises, users can find a list of climate risk data providers, tools and products
  [here](climate_narrative/climate-financial-risk-forum-climate-risk-product-providers-latest.xlsx)
  and in the links on the bottom of each page of the tool. This database of climate risk data
  providers, tools, and products has been compiled on a best-efforts basis and is not exhaustive.
  It has been created to serve as an illustrative list of current climate risk offerings,
  highlighting the variety and scope of what is currently available in the marketplace. Inclusion on
  the list does not indicate use of or endorsement by the CFRF.

  ## How to use the tool?

  The tool can generate two types of report:

    - an Institutional Report which gives a report tailored to your institution
    - a Sector Report which allows users to see the content for an individual sector

  ### Institutional Report

  Selecting this report type will take you to a series of screens where you need
  to input some basic information regarding your firm's business activities,
  products, and materiality of exposures to an asset class, sector, or liability class.

  Materiality is entered based on:

  - High: One of your top 5 exposures or more than 10% of total assets
  - Medium: 5% - 10% of total assets
  - Low: below 5% of total assets
  - N/A: negligible or no exposure

  The tool outputs an executive summary and a detailed long form report.
  Based on materiality and the NGFS scenario selected, the tool will output different
  levels of detail in the reports. Where low or medium materiality is selected, the tool
  will output a summary narrative. Where high materiality is selected, the tool will output
  a more detailed narrative.

  ### Sector Report

  Selecting this report type will take you straight to the final report page which will
  allow you to select the detailed narrative by sector and climate scenario.

  ## Report Structure

  On the final report page select the relevant NGFS scenario (i.e. Orderly, Disorderly, Too-little-too-late
  or Hot House World) and for the Sector Report also pick a sector (specific sectors can 
  also be selected in an Institutional Report to filter the report).

  The executive summary covers the following:

  - A summary of the key assumptions and parameters used in the selected NGFS scenario
  - For each sector, underwriting and asset class as well as lending exposure type
     (ordered from high to low materiality):

    - Tables summarising the selected exposure type and highlighting the materiality
    - A summary narrative for high materiality exposures
    - A table of one-liners for medium and low materiality exposures

  The long form report covers the following:

  - A more detailed description of key assumptions and parameters used in the selected NGFS scenario
  - For each sector, underwriting and asset class as well as lending exposure type
    (ordered from high to low materiality):

    - A description of each lending exposure type, underwriting class, asset class and sector selected
    - Detailed narratives for high materiality exposures
    - A summary narrative for medium and low materiality exposures

  The tool will also generate a report covering a stand-alone description for an
  underwriting class or economic sector in a particular NGFS scenario.

  ## Limitations

  There are several uncertainties and limitations associated with the tool, for example: 
  the tool is based on NGFS Phase V scenarios (November 2024) and is only updated periodically to enhance content. 
  
  The scenarios are neither a forecast of what is likely to happen nor a description of what should happen, 
  but an illustration of what could happen (this does include some adverse scenarios, however the global spike 
  in energy prices in 2022, due in part to the war in Ukraine, was both more adverse and more immediate than any 
  of the scenarios designed ex ante - the NGFS published a  [note](https://www.ngfs.net/sites/default/files/media/2022/09/07/not_too_late_-_confronting_the_growing_odds_of_a_late_and_disorderly_transition.pdf)
  to demonstrate the relevance of the NGFS scenarios to this situation). The NGFS scenarios are underpinned 
  by a subset of models, e.g. REMIND, GCAM and MESSAGE, which make particular assumptions about long-term 
  technology pathways that are of course highly uncertain. Such models also assume smooth adjustment processes 
  and largely proxy climate policy through carbon pricing. 

  This tool may be useful for climate reporting and risk assessments. However, a limitation for those seeking 
  to embed climate-related risks and opportunities into their risk management framework and investment decision making 
  is that it does not specify a baseline related directly to what is priced into assets today. It also does not allow for 
  meaningful variation in the implementation of climate policies across geographies and sectors, nor alternative technology pathways. 

  Similarly, the tool does not provide a mechanism to test how financial exposures may differ if the solar friendly 
  technology pathways of the REMIND model do not come to pass. Relaxing these policy and technology universality assumptions 
  will naturally generate quite different assessments of the climate exposures of different financial securities and assets.

  The NGFS Phase 5 scenarios have several limitations that should be carefully considered, for example:

    - The scenarios rely on simplified assumptions about future policies, technologies, and economic developments, 
    which do not fully capture the complexities of real-world transitions as well as the complex interconnectivity of risks. 
    For example, there is limited consideration of incentives to lower solely non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (e.g., methane) which would be 
    pertinent levers for sectors such as livestock farming and energy; the global transition investment exceeded $2 Trillion for 
    the First Time in 2024 – ahead of NGFS scenarios by 5 years
    - NiGEM, used for understanding the macroeconomic impacts as a response to the different transition pathways, 
    is a Single-Agent General Equilibrium Model. These models excel in understanding the wider macroeconomic response, 
    but are not designed to model intra-group competition, inequalities, or variation, and extra caution is advised in 
    examining individual companies or sovereigns modelled within a group.
    - Sovereigns are split in their modelling between “Full Country” economic models, “Reduced Country Models”, and 
    “Regional Block” models. As such, certain nations (including Brazil and India) are modelled at the reduced level 
    (they lack a modelled government sector that must strike any balance between tax revenues and spending, and use a 
    simplified model for primary energy production).
    - They do not fully account for physical impacts, including tipping points and compound risks. 
    For example, certain relevant and material acute physical risks are not comprehensively modelled as only four acute physical 
    impacts are modelled using one transmission channel (flood and cyclones through capital asset damages; droughts through crop 
    yield losses; heatwaves through labour productivity decline.
    - The societal impacts, such as climate-induced migration, are not thoroughly considered and are assumed to be the same across these scenarios.
    - The Orderly Below 2&deg;C scenario generates a common carbon price for the global power and transportation sectors. Whereas in the 
    Net Zero 2050 scenario there are regional differences in carbon price, and in the Fragmented World scenario there are sectoral differences
    in carbon price, as well as between, say EU and US and China.
    - There is significant uncertainty about future technology developments and government policy changes, which can affect the accuracy of the scenarios.
    - The climate scenarios focus on the most likely outcomes rather than the tail events where there is an 18% change of equilibrium climate sensitivity 
    being greater than 4.5&deg;C. For further information please see the paper produced by the Institute of Actuaries Climate Scorpion – the sting is 
    in the tail Introducing planetary solvency.


  For the purposes of this report, NiGEM calculated Carbon Prices have been used, with REMIND-MAgPIE inputs. This is as opposed to 
  the REMIND-MAgPIE carbon prices that directly model the energy changes. This was done for consistency across the countries assessed, 
  as the REMIND-MAgPIE model is split into 12 regions and carbon policy modelling is uniform within those regions. Whilst the NiGEM Carbon 
  Prices are not in use by the model, they are indicators of the transition ambition of sovereigns under different climate transition scenarios, 
  and as they are themselves abstractions of climate policy, they are displayed throughout for sovereigns. REMIND-MAgPIE allows for carbon prices 
  to be available for the US, China, India, and Japan, as well as the European Union, without any need for downscaling for these entities. 
  
  ### What is next?

  The Climate Financial Risk Forum Scenario Analysis Working Group will update the tool periodically to 
  enhance content, including to reflect future updates to NGFS scenarios.
