  Sovereign (or government) bonds are debt securities issued by governments 
  to support government spending. Governments agree to repay the face value of 
  the bond at a specified maturity date and may also pay interest, in the form 
  of coupon payments, at regular intervals throughout the term. Bonds are used 
  to finance and raise capital for the state’s general expenditures and operations, 
  or are earmarked for certain projects such as infrastructure and housing, or 
  nature restoration and climate adaptation.
  
  The government bond sector is a broad category that includes “sovereign” debt, 
  which is issued and generally backed by a central government. UK Gilts, US Treasuries, 
  German Bunds, Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), Brazilian Government Bonds and Government 
  of Canada Bonds (GoCs) are all examples of sovereign government bonds. The US, Japan and 
  Europe have historically been the biggest issuers in the government bond market. Several 
  governments also issue sovereign bonds that are linked to inflation, known as inflation-linked 
  bonds or, in the US, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). 
  
  On an inflation-linked bond, the interest and/or principal is adjusted on a regular basis to 
  reflect changes in the rate of inflation, thus providing a “real,” or inflation-adjusted, return. 
  But, unlike other bonds, inflation-linked bonds could experience greater losses when real interest 
  rates are moving faster than nominal interest rates.

  In addition to sovereign bonds, the government bond sector includes subcomponents, such as:

  - Agency and “quasi-government” bonds: Central governments pursue various goals - 
    supporting affordable housing or the development of small businesses, for example - 
    through agencies, a number of which issue bonds to support their operations. 
    Some agency bonds are guaranteed by the central government while others are not. 
    Supranational organisations, like the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, 
    also borrow in the bond market to finance public projects and/or development.

  - Local government bonds: Local governments - whether provinces, states or cities - 
    borrow to finance a variety of projects, from bridges to schools, as well as general 
    operations. The market for local government bonds is well established in the US, 
    where these bonds are known as municipal bonds. Other developed markets also 
    issue provincial/local government  bonds.

  In this report we refer to a ‘20-notch’ sovereign bond rating scale translated 
  from S&P’s alphabetical standardized rating scale (see Appendix), which is used to 
  outline changes to sovereign bond ratings, as is common in surrounding literature. 
  Impacts of climate change on sovereign bond ratings are discussed in reference to the 
  2021 working paper titled “Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate 
  Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness” from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy. 
  This study represents one approach towards quantifying the effects of climate change 
  on credit ratings and is illustrative based on a hypothetical model. Whilst conclusions 
  are referred to on the impact on bond ratings, it is worth highlighting that this report 
  focuses on the physical climate risk impacts on credit ratings, and not on the demands 
  of transition, nor on the knock-on effects that climate change may cause or exacerbate 
  such as resource conflicts, political volatility, or supply chain disruptions.

      In the Delayed Transition scenario, late policy reaction, societal change 
      and national energy strategies could lead to significant, albeit delayed 
      increases in the implicit carbon prices. This could have an impact on 
      sovereign bonds in countries with a strong level of dependence on fossil 
      fuel energy sources as well as a risk of short-term investment shocks.
    always: |
      In the Delayed Transition scenario, late policy action means that a 
      “Business as Usual” approach to decarbonisation occurs between now and 2030, 
      followed by a sharp increase in policy aggression. This means that the initial 
      effective carbon price increases at a slower rate compared to Orderly scenarios until 2030, 
      but significantly higher effective carbon prices thereafter as countries make up for lost ground. 
      
      These scenarios could have a very strong impact on fiscal revenues in countries with a strong 
      level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources. Industries that are negatively impacted by 
      transition risk, such as mining, oil and gas could have reduced revenues from lower fossil fuel 
      demand and increased costs from significantly higher carbon taxes.
      
      On the other hand, government spending (through subsidies and investment) could encourage 
      consumer spending and investment in the use of renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage, etc, 
      leading to increases in fiscal revenues. The Delayed transition risk scenarios could also 
      lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This would have a negative impact on Chinese sovereign bonds.

      **Carbon tax effect**

      Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure to 
      carbon intensive sectors and technologies. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors 
      such as oil and gas are consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition risk. 
      
      The impact of Delayed transition risk scenarios on fiscal revenues is largely 
      dependent on the efficiency of government spending in trying to mitigate these risks. 
      While the use of taxes to incentivize more environmentally friendly production, 
      transportation and consumption patterns can help economies transition to a net 
      zero scenario, a poorly managed transition policy could lead to shocks in economic activity. 
      Depending on the respective country’s size of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, green 
      policies, such as carbon taxes would impact, positively or negatively, firms’ profitability, 
      which would, in turn, impact fiscal revenues.
      
      In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction means that a ‘Business as Usual’ 
      approach to decarbonisation occurs between now and 2030, followed by a sharp increase in 
      policy aggression, equivalent to an implicit/proxy carbon price increase to approximately 
      388.9 USD per tonne CO<sub>2</sub> by 2035 and about 2,582.2 USD by 2050 based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario 
      Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs)

      The delayed policy ambition reduces the initial disincentivisation against fossil fuels, 
      only to more aggressively penalise and thus risk stranding fossil fuel assets beyond 2030. 
      In this scenario, disorderly policy action results in increased transition risks.

      Based on data from IEA (see below graph), in 2023 the renewables share of power in China 
      is characterized by a mix where coal remains dominant at 62% making it one of the most 
      coal-reliant power sectors out of the world’s biggest emitters. Hydro accounts for 15%, 
      natural gas for 3%, nuclear for 5%, oil at >1%, solar PV at 5%, wind at 9% and other sources at 2%. 
      This mix reflects a significant reliance on coal, although non-fossil sources are steadily growing.

      China's latest renewable energy plan, unveiled in October 2024, aims to significantly boost 
      renewable energy consumption. This represents a strategic shift from merely expanding capacity 
      to fostering systemic demand through infrastructure upgrades and sectoral integration. 
      
      China's policy direction towards achieving a phase-down of coal remains complex. 
      On one hand, the country continues to invest heavily in renewable energy projects, 
      including new offshore wind farms and large-scale clean energy bases. On the other hand, 
      China approved 66.7 GW of new coal-fired power capacity in 2024, marking a 10-year high in 
      coal power construction, though it is worth noting that the capacity factor of China’s 
      coal-fired powerplants has been sharply decreasing over time, as they switch towards 
      more of a grid-stability role, providing demand-following power as opposed to baseload. 
      The government is also expanding its fossil gas infrastructure to increase the share of 
      fossil gas in the primary energy mix.
      
      **GDP growth effect**

      A change in a country’s GDP could have an impact on the level of fiscal revenue 
      it receives. Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could 
      lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, 
      Delayed transition could result in significant GDP losses. World GDP impacts 
      from transition risks are negative as the speed of the transition combines with 
      investment uncertainty and affects consumption and investment.
      
      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), 
      the expected impact (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) 
      of a Delayed Transition scenario on China’s GDP is estimated to be around –3.5% by 2025, 
      reaching approximately –6.0% by 2030 and around –12.4% by 2050.

      **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**

      Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. 
      No sovereign has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related risks it faces, 
      although rating agencies anticipate that climate trends could have implications for 
      ratings in coming decades. According to the 2021 “Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: 
      The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign Creditworthiness” working paper from the 
      University of Cambridge, in the Delayed Transition scenario, most developed countries 
      would be marginally downgraded (1 notch or less). Most downgrades would be among top-rated 
      countries. This does not necessarily reflect increased climate-related risks for these 
      top-rated countries, but greater sensitivity of the top ratings. It is easier to lose 
      an AAA rating than a C rating. 
      
      According to the study, in a transition risk (RCP 2.6) scenario, China would experience 
      a downgrade of approximately 2 notches by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for 
      the Chinese government by a debt range of roughly US$4.03–6.05bn. This modest adjustment 
      reflects China’s capacity to eventually realign its energy policies despite initial delays, 
      thereby limiting any significant increase in borrowing costs.

      In Orderly transition scenarios, immediate policy reaction, societal change and

      carbon prices. This could have a strong impact on fiscal revenues in countries 
      with a strong level of dependence on fossil fuel energy sources. Industries that 
      are negatively impacted by transition risk, such as mining, oil and gas could have 
      reduced revenues from lower fossil fuel demand and increased costs from higher carbon taxes.

      consumer spending and investment in the use of renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage, etc,

      reduction in GDP growth. This would have a limited, neutral impact on Chinese sovereign bonds.

      **Carbon tax effect**

      Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure to carbon intensive 
      sectors and technologies. Countries with carbon intensive sectors such as oil and gas are 
      consequently some of the most vulnerable to transition risk.

      The impact from the Orderly scenarios on fiscal revenues is largely dependent on the efficiency 
      of government spending in trying to mitigate these risks. While the use of taxes to incentivize 
      more environmentally friendly production, transportation and consumption patterns can help economies 
      transition to a net zero scenario, a poorly managed transition policy could lead to shocks in economic 
      activity. Depending on the respective country’s size of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, green 
      policies, such as carbon taxes would impact, positively or negatively, firms’ profitability, which would, 
      in turn, impact fiscal revenues. Conversely, countries with a relatively high energy intensity and 
      dependence on fossil fuels, such as China, are more vulnerable to transition risks.

      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the implicit/proxy carbon 
      pricing in USD per tonne absolute difference is highest in the Net Zero 2050 scenario compared 
      to Below 2&deg;C (at 2030, approximately 125.8 USD per tonne CO₂ for Below 2&deg;C, compared to roughly 
      894.9 USD for Net Zero 2050; and for 2050, about 1,193.8 USD for Below 2&deg;C versus around 6,746.5 USD 
      for Net Zero 2050). The effective pricing is a proxy for the difference in policy ambition required 
      to limit warming to a maximum of 1.5&deg;C (versus 2&deg;C in the Below 2&deg;C scenario).

      A change in a country’s GDP could have an impact on the level of fiscal revenue it receives. 
      Assuming taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in 
      fiscal revenue. According to estimates from the NGFS, the Orderly transition scenarios would 
      generally limit GDP losses. The world GDP losses from chronic physical and transition effects 
      are estimated to be around -3% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) 
      by 2050. World GDP impacts from transition risk are moderately negative in the Net Zero 2050 
      scenario as negative impacts on demand from higher carbon prices and energy costs are only 
      partially offset by the recycling of carbon revenues into government investment and lower 
      employment taxes. 
      
      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the GDP losses from 
      chronic physical and transition effects for China are estimated to be around –3.3% (relative 
      to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2025, reaching approximately –5.9% by 
      2030 and from –7.5% to –10.9% by 2050.

      increasing the cost of borrowing for the Chinese government by a debt range

      of the climate change committed by historical emissions would have a significant 
      impact on China’s ability to raise capital for the transition.

      In a high physical risk scenario, physical risks would undermine GDP growth due to loss of land, 
      changing crop yields, depleted natural resources, lower productivity of the workforce, damages 
      to infrastructure, etc. Chronic and acute risks could result in lower tax revenues or higher 
      insurance premiums. This could result in a negative impact on GDP globally by 2100 and hit 
      governments’ finances. Extreme weather events such as wildfires, floods, and heat waves could 
      become more prevalent, impacting households, businesses, cities and states. There are also 
      likely indirect risks, such as those caused by international migration (e.g. increased inequalities, 
      labour right issues, social conflicts), or via biodiversity loss, or to industries’ supply chains and international trade.
      
      Wet bulb temperatures, which combine heat and humidity, could reach levels that make outdoor 
      work unsafe in some regions. This would severely impact labour productivity, especially in 
      sectors like agriculture and construction, where outdoor work is prevalent. 
      
      A study at the University of Exeter (Hot weather hits productivity – even in air-conditioned factories - News) 
      further found that productivity dropped even in air-conditioned factories. For example, productivity 
      dropped by 5.8% when wet-bulb temperatures exceeded 28°C.
      
      The high physical risk scenario could lead to a reduction in GDP growth. 
      This would have a negative impact on Chinese sovereign bonds.
      
      As global temperatures rise in a high physical risk scenario, the effects of climate change, 
      including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in drylands and water scarcity, will likely lead 
      to changes in patterns of human migration. Climate migration could lead to increasing political 
      instability. With people in less developed regions more likely to leave affected areas, this may 
      cause conflicts in receiving regions. Indeed, even within a country, climate change could lead to 
      higher inequality due to slow economic growth in particular areas. As a result, political instability 
      could rise due to climate related risk issues, both within and between countries.

      In a high physical risk scenario, global mean temperatures compared to pre‑industrial levels

      (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing higher warming). These changes could 
      lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, 
      and sea‑level rise. It can also further change the frequency and severity of weather events such as 
      heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.

Physical damages have been plotted but this causes an underestimate of the true damages to the GDP for the “Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)” scenario and for the existing transition risks facing the economy in a “Current Policies” scenario.
      
      Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including climate resilience

      China would face a downgrade of roughly 6 notches by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for 
      the Chinese government by a debt range of roughly US$12.92–19.38bn. This significant adjustment 
      reflects the increased vulnerability from widespread infrastructure damage, declining productivity, 
      and higher adaptation costs, all of which contribute to elevated borrowing costs.

      As global temperatures rise in a high physical and transition risk scenario, the 
      effects of climate change, including coastal flooding, reduced rainfall in drylands 
      and water scarcity, will likely lead to changes in patterns of human migration. Climate migration 
      could lead to increasing political instability. With people in less developed regions more likely 
      to leave affected areas, this may cause conflicts in receiving regions. Indeed, even within a country, 
      climate change could lead to higher inequality due to slow economic growth in particular areas. As a result, 
      political instability could rise due to climate related risk issues, both within and between countries.
      
      Divergent and delayed climate policies could exacerbate these impacts by creating inconsistent regulatory 
      environments and economic disruptions. These inconsistencies can lead to higher operational costs for businesses, 
      impacting employment and economic stability. Additionally, the lack of cohesive policy frameworks may hinder 
      the effectiveness of climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, further exacerbating the risks associated

      pledges and net-zero targets would only be partially achieved, while other countries follow a mix of current policies, 
      and inadequate expansions of these polices, leading to increased regional inequality which would exacerbate 
      regional tensions as well as the physical risk impacts.

      **Carbon tax effect**

      In Transition risks for sovereigns are largely associated with the exposure to carbon intensive sectors 
      and technologies. Countries with carbon-intensive sectors such as oil and gas are consequently some of 
      the most vulnerable to transition risk.
      
      The impact of a Too-Little-Too-Late scenario on fiscal revenues is largely dependent on the efficiency 
      of government spending in trying to mitigate these risks. While the use of taxes to incentivize more 
      environmentally friendly production, transportation and consumption patterns can help economies transition 
      to a net zero scenario, a poorly managed transition policy could lead to shocks in economic activity. 
      Depending on the respective country’s size of fossil fuel or renewable energy sectors, green policies, 
      such as carbon taxes would impact, positively or negatively, firms’ profitability, which would, in turn, 
      impact fiscal revenues.
      
      In the High physical and transition risk (Too-little-too-late) scenario, late and uncoordinated policy 
      reaction means that a ‘Business as Usual’ approach to decarbonisation occurs between now and 2030, 
      followed by a somewhat subdued increase in policy aggression, equivalent to an implicit/proxy carbon 
      price increase to ~11 USD per tonne CO₂ by 2035 and ~118 USD by 2050 based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario 
      Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs). The delayed policy ambition reduces the initial disincentivisation 
      against fossil fuels, only to more aggressively penalise and thus risk stranding fossil fuel assets beyond 2030. 
      In this scenario, disorderly policy action results in increased transition risks. For China specifically, the 
      definition of the Fragmented World scenario leads to a lower ambition than most, keeping to only a very modest 
      increase in ambition from current decarbonisation policies.

      **GDP growth effect**

      In a high physical and transition risk scenario (i.e. too little too late), global mean temperatures 
      compared to pre industrial levels could increase across the world by 1.5°C by 2030, by 1.9°C by 2050 
      and ultimately 2.4°C by 2100 (with land warming faster than oceans and high latitudes experiencing 
      higher warming). These changes will lead to chronic changes in living conditions affecting health, 
      labour productivity, agriculture, ecosystems, and sea level rise, which will consequently impact 
      the rate of growth in GDP. It can also change the frequency and severity of weather events such as 
      heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones, and flooding.
      
      Research from Burke et al (2015) indicates there is a non-linear effect of increasing temperature on 
      economic output, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13°C and declining 
      strongly at higher temperatures. In a high physical risk scenario, unmitigated warming is expected 
      to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes by roughly 23% by 2100, relative 
      to scenarios without climate change.
      
      This declining productivity would affect GDP and government income, as tax revenues are dependent 
      on economic output. Adaptation costs would cause further strain to fiscal expenditures. Assuming 
      taxation rates remain unchanged, a decrease in GDP could lead to a reduction in fiscal revenue. 
      Based on the IIASA NGFS Scenario Explorer NiGEM model (REMIND inputs), the expected impact of a 
      Fragmented World (too‑little‑too‑late) scenario on China’s GDP, from chronic physical and transition effects, 
      is estimated to roughly around –13.8% (relative to a baseline with no transition or physical risks) by 2050.

      Opportunities could arise from mitigation actions, including climate resilience investments 
      (e.g. to cope with flooding risks that would propel the growth of economic sectors providing 
      the underlying solutions in terms of products and services).

      **Downgrading of credit ratings effect**

      Climate-related risks are, to some extent, priced in the sovereign bond market. No 
      sovereign has yet been downgraded because of the climate-related risks it faces, although 
      rating agencies anticipate that climate trends will have implications for ratings in coming decades. 
      According to the 2021 “Rising Temperatures, Falling Ratings: The Effect of Climate Change on Sovereign 
      Creditworthiness” working paper from the University of Cambridge, in a high physical risk scenario (RCP 8.5), 
      most developed countries would be significantly downgraded, with an average downgrade exceeding two notches by 
      2100. Most downgrades would be among top-rated countries. 
      
      China would face a downgrade of roughly 6 notches by 2100, increasing the cost of borrowing for the Chinese government 
      by a debt range of roughly US$12.92–19.38bn. This significant adjustment reflects the increased vulnerability from 
      widespread infrastructure damage, declining productivity, and higher adaptation costs, all of which contribute to 
      elevated borrowing costs.
      
      **Transition impacts**

      Transition Impacts corresponding to a High Transition and Physical Risk (Too-Little-Too-Late) scenario include:
        - **Inconsistent regulatory environments**: Divergent climate policies could lead to 
        regulatory uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to plan and invest. 
        For example, mixed messages on carbon pricing and the slow implementation of climate 
        policies by China has created uncertainty for businesses along the belt and road initiative.
        - **Economic disruptions**: Delayed and fragmented policies may cause economic instability, 
        affecting various sectors differently and leading to uneven growth. 
        - **Higher operational costs**: Businesses may face increased costs due to the need to comply 
        with varying regulations and invest in climate adaptation measures.
        - **Impact on employment**: Economic disruptions and higher operational costs could lead 
        to job losses and reduced employment opportunities.
        - **Ineffective climate adaptation and mitigation**: Lack of cohesive policy frameworks 
        may hinder efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change, exacerbating physical risks. 
        - **Increased inequality and regional tensions**: Fragmented policies could lead to disparities 
        in climate action, exacerbating social and economic inequalities and regional tensions. 
        Regional disparities within China (in particular, between the rural regions in western 
        provinces dependent on extraction activities, and the more urbanised eastern coast) 
        highlight significant inequalities and internal tension, with some areas facing higher 
        unemployment and lower incomes, which could be worsened by uneven climate action.
