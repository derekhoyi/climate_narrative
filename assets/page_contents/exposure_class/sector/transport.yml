  description: |
    The transport sector refers to the movement of people and cargo, either as a service or 
    via consumer activity, as well as the construction, maintenance, and use of transportation 
    infrastructure. The transport sector includes subsectors for each mode 
    (Air, Rail, Water, Road), which is then further subdivided by freight or passenger, and 
    by vehicle type where relevant. In addition, there are support services for the transport 
    sector that are also included, such as logistics support for freight (e.g. Warehousing, 
    Storage, Packing, Crating). 
    
    Example companies in the transport sector would be airlines that carry passengers as 
    well as belly freight, trucking that delivers goods by road, or Urban Rail Metro services 
    that provide passenger transport. Whilst OEMs who manufacture transportation vehicles would 
    follow trends in industry, the demand for their vehicles depends on the longer-term expected 
    trends that transport activity undergoes.
