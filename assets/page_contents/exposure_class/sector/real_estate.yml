  name: Real Estate Sector
  test_report_position: 8
  description: |
    The real estate sector encompasses a wide range of activities and services 
    related to real estate incorporating both commercial & residential real estate. 
    This sector includes companies primarily engaged in renting or leasing real estate 
    to others, managing real estate for others, selling or buying real estate for others, 
    and providing various real estate related services, such as appraisal services.

    This sector includes equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) that are
    primarily engaged in leasing buildings, dwellings, or other real estate
    property to others. They play a significant role in providing residential and 
    commercial spaces. This sector also includes firms involved in:

    - Acting as lessors of buildings that are both used and not used as residences
      or dwellings, such as single-family homes, apartment buildings, and town
      homes:

      - Firms acting as lessors of buildings that are used as residences or
        dwellings, including owner-lessors and establishments renting real estate and
        then acting as lessors in subleasing it to others.

      - Firms acting as lessors of buildings that are not used as residences or
        dwellings, including owner-lessors of non-residential buildings, establishments 
        renting real estate and then acting as lessors in subleasing it to others, and 
        establishments providing full-service office space, whether on a lease or 
        service contract basis.

    - Renting or leasing space to others for self-storage. These establishments
      provide secure space (i.e., rooms, compartments, lockers, containers, or
      outdoor space) where clients can store and retrieve their goods;

    - Acting as lessors of real estate (except buildings), such as manufactured
      home (i.e., mobile home) sites, vacant lots, and grazing land;

    - Providing real estate services (except lessors of real estate and offices of
      real estate agents and brokers). Included in this industry group are
      establishments primarily engaged in activities, such as managing real estate
      for others and appraising real estate.

        In the Delayed Tansition scenario, the real estate sector could be impacted by 
        an increase in carbon price and through the cost of complying with “lower 
        carbon/green” building criteria which in turn could affect the profitability 
        in this sector. In these scenarios a limited relative reduction in GDP growth 
        will also impact the sector.

      always: |
        In the Delayed Tansition scenario, the demand for real estate is likely to increase. 
        While the real estate sector could continue to play a role in meeting customer demand 
        for the coming years, the late policy action under the Delayed transition scenario 
        beyond 2030 could lead to a relative reduction in GDP growth. This could partially 
        offset any growth in demand. 

      high_materiality: |
        The transition changes could translate into financial impacts:

        - **Increased revenues**: for "lower carbon / green" buildings meeting demand
          as companies have to decarbonise their own operations;

        - **Decreased revenues**: from, and stranding of, assets that fail to meet
          customer criteria and/or government regulations on energy efficiency,
          use and HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) technologies;

        - **Changes or disruption to revenues**: due to changing customer base from
          transition exposure (can reduce or increase revenues depending upon net
          exposure);

        - **Increase in repair, refurbishment and operating costs**: due to
          government regulations, taxation and meeting customer criteria;

        - **Increased revenues**: from retrofits and conversions to lower carbon /
          energy efficient buildings.

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, buildings increase their use of electricity 
        over time from 54 exajoules (EJ) in 2025 to 93 EJ in 2050, while natural gas 
        consumption decreases from 29 EJ in 2025 to 6 EJ in 2050.

        In the Delayed Transition scenario, as carbon price increases, carbon 
        tax paid from buildings’ emissions peaks at ~$365 billion around 2035. 
        The carbon tax paid begins to decrease thereafter as improvements are 
        made to buildings’ emissions intensities.

        The materiality of the exposures is very granular dependent upon the attributes of 
        the property and the vibrancy of both the local and global economies. Where local 
        economies are particularly exposed to revenues (directly or indirectly) from high 
        transition risk industries, such as coal, oil & gas extraction, or from industries 
        with transition risks arising from their supply chains, such as deforestation-related 
        reputational risks in the supply chains companies, then knock-on effects would be 
        expected to revenues and occupancy.
        
        Real estate companies can mitigate risks in a delayed transition world by diversifying 
        their client base to reduce dependency on any single sector, supporting local initiatives 
        to introduce new business lines in high-risk areas, and strategically divesting stranded 
        assets that may lose value due to delayed transition efforts. Investing in energy-efficient 
        technologies and renewable energy sources to decarbonise assets, obtaining sustainable 
        building certifications, and proactively adapting to regulatory changes are also crucial. 
        Monitoring market trends, embracing smart building technologies, and maintaining robust 
        climate risk management frameworks, along with effective communication of sustainability 
        efforts, can enhance their reputation and build stakeholder trust.

        In Orderly Transition scenarios, the real estate sector could be impacted by an 
        increase in carbon prices and the cost of complying with “lower carbon/green” 
        building criteria, which in turn could affect the profitability in this sector. 
        In these scenarios a limited relative reduction in GDP growth will also impact 
        the sector. 

      always: |
        In Orderly transition scenarios, the demand for the real estate is likely to increase. 
        While the real estate sector could continue to play a role in meeting customer demand 
        for the coming years, the changing patterns in energy generation in these scenarios, 
        driven by immediate policy reaction, societal change, national energy strategies, and 
        carbon legislation, could lead to an immediate and smooth reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions by 2050.
        
        The increase in the carbon price as well as a change to the demand in the quality of 
        the real estate product (e.g. emissions from the construction and fabric of the building, 
        energy efficiency performance and use of lower carbon technology (especially heating and 
        cooling)) is likely to influence the profitability of this sector. The Orderly transition 
        scenarios could also lead to a limited relative reduction in GDP growth. This could 
        partially offset growth in demand for the Real Estate sector.

      high_materiality: |
        The changes in carbon pricing, societal preference, energy prices and
        energy mix could potentially impact the real estate sector as a result 
        in one or more of the following impacts:

        - **Increased revenues**: this could occur for "lower carbon/green" buildings 
          meeting demand as companies have to decarbonise their own operations;

        - **Decreased revenues of assets**: this could occur for assets that fail to 
          meet customer criteria and/or government regulations on energy efficiency, 
          use and HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) technologies;

        - **Changes or disruption to revenues**: this could occur due to changing customer 
          base from transition exposure (can reduce or increase revenues depending upon net
          exposure);

        - **Increase in repair and refurbishment costs**: this could occur in order to meet 
          government regulations, taxation and customer criteria;

        - **Increased revenues**: this could occur from retrofits and conversions to lower carbon /
          energy efficient buildings.
        
        In Orderly Transition scenarios, buildings increase their use of electricity over time 
        from between 50 to 60 exajoules (EJ) in 2025 to between 90 EJ and 102 EJ in 2050, 
        while natural gas consumption decreases from between 28 to 31 EJ in 2025 to 15 and 
        below EJ in 2050.

        In Orderly Transition scenarios, as carbon price increases, carbon tax paid from 
        buildings' emissions peaks at ~$443 billion (inflation adjusted to 2010 baseline) 
        around 2035 in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, and below ~$151 billion around 2035 in 
        the Below 2&deg;C scenario. Carbon tax paid begins to decrease thereafter as 
        improvements are made to buildings’ emissions intensities in both Net Zero 2050 and 
        Low Demand scenarios to be below ~$100 billion, however, it continues to increase 
        in the below 2&deg;C scenario to be around ~$200 billion.

        Real estate companies can mitigate risks in an orderly transition with the highest transition

        As the real estate sector is highly reliant on revenues attached to assets at fixed locations, 
        this means that it is particularly exposed to the physical impacts of climate change. 
        In addition to direct damage, extreme temperatures can materially impact the revenues of 
        assets that are not adapted to these changes as this could potentially affect the productivity 
        of assets and labour.

        As the real estate sector is highly reliant on revenues attached to assets at fixed locations, 
        this means that it is particularly exposed to the physical impacts of climate change: these 
        include chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels) and acute effects due to changes to frequency 
        and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, cyclones and flooding.
        
        Floods, storms and extreme temperatures damage buildings, with the former particularly acute 
        for assets on flood plains or located in low-lying coastal areas. In addition to direct damage, 
        extreme temperatures can materially impact the revenues of assets that are not adapted to these 
        changes as this could potentially affect the productivity of assets and labour.

      high_materiality: |
        Property values themselves may be impacted by the occurrence, or risk of
        occurrence, of climate-related events from both acute and chronic impacts 
        as outlined below:

        **Acute impacts**

        - **Cyclones or storms**: Cyclones and storms are likely to have a significant effect on real estate. 
          For example, residential and commercial properties can be severely damaged, leading to decreased 
          property values. 
        
        - **Coastal and river flooding**: Rising sea levels and changes in precipitation patterns could pose 
          flooding risks to real estate with real estate in coastal areas being particularly vulnerable. 
          For example, Miami and New York are projected to experience significant declines in property 
          values due to rising sea levels.

        **Chronic impacts**

        - **Raised Sea Levels**: Coastal properties are particularly vulnerable to raised sea levels, 
          which can lead to flooding and erosion, significantly impacting property values.

        - **Extreme Temperatures**: Increased temperatures can affect the structural integrity of buildings 
          and increase maintenance costs. For example, higher temperatures can lead to more frequent use 
          of HVAC systems, increasing operational costs.

        - **Drought**: Drought conditions can lead to greater competition for scarce water resources, 
          impacting the viability of properties in affected areas. This can also lead to increased 
          costs for water usage and management.

        - **Wildfires**: Areas prone to wildfires can see significant declines in property values 
          due to the risk of destruction and increased insurance premiums.
        
        The above impacts can manifest in the following areas:

        - **Property prices**: Historically, property price declines after climate events have 
          generally been modest and short-lived in locations where there is strong awareness of, 
          and experience with, extreme weather-related events (particularly flooding and exposure 
          to hurricanes/cyclones). However, recent evidence suggests that certain events can lead 
          to a long-lasting decline in prices or liquidity in geographies that have been relatively 
          unexposed to extreme weather or climate events, or where intensity and frequency have 
          appreciably increased.

        - **Liquidity**: Trading volumes or time on market may provide early signals of how 
          markets are reacting to climate events and risks through lower liquidity that could 
          ultimately feed into prices.

        - **Higher risk premiums**: Commercial owners/investors in some geographies are placing a 
          higher risk premium on all properties in metro areas affected by climate events, regardless 
          of whether their individual properties have been directly affected.

        - **Short-term value drops**: For areas affected by wildfires, floods and storms, property 
          prices can drop significantly in the short term. However, these drops might be partially 
          balanced by the value of amenities in the area. Additionally, although there are a few 
          commercial studies on this topic, they suggest that the benefits of being in a city 
          (i.e. urban agglomeration) tend to persist and can offset the perceived risks from 
          climate events.

        - **Access to information**: Better information in risks and mitigation measures leads to 
          greater awareness, belief acceptance and integration of climate impacts on prices achieved.

        Consideration should be made on whether changes to climatic patterns occur - for instance 
        we are already experiencing the slowing down of jet streams that lead to previously 
        short-lived extreme events now prolonging. This could also extend to previously regions 
        of stable weather / climatic systems experiencing new extreme weather events. Valuation 
        practices, which are largely driven by lagging indicators, suffer from a paucity of 
        climate risk-related evidence and available data. As shown below, the labour productivity 
        steadily reduces in both the current policies and NDCs scenarios eventually reaching a 
        low of between -2.5% to -2.7% in 2050. This could have a knock-on impact on the revenue 
        of the assets linked to the reduced productivity.

        Real estate companies can mitigate physical risks in a high-risk climate scenario by 
        enhancing building resilience through infrastructure upgrades, implementing flood defence 
        systems, and using climate-resilient landscaping. They should focus on investing in 
        energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy sources to decarbonise assets, 
        obtain sustainable building certifications where possible, and proactively adapt to 
        regulatory changes. Monitoring market trends and embracing smart building technologies 
        can help them stay competitive. Robust climate risk management frameworks and effective 
        communication of sustainability efforts can enhance their reputation and build stakeholder 
        trust. These actions collectively position real estate companies for long-term success 
        despite the challenges posed by climate change.

        Transition risks involve regulatory changes, where stricter building codes and energy 
        efficiency standards increase costs for retrofitting and developing properties. Market 
        preferences are shifting towards sustainable and energy-efficient buildings, reducing 
        demand for older, less efficient properties. Rapid advancements in green building technologies 
        can render existing properties obsolete, and failure to address climate-related risks can 
        damage a firm's reputation, affecting market position and investor confidence.

      high_materiality: |
        There would both high physical and transition risks from a too-little-too-late scenario 
        as a result of the delayed (“too late”) implementation and ultimately diverging in their 
        mitigation stringency, thus rendering the overall efforts insufficient to reach net zero 
        (“too little”). Countries with net zero targets achieve these only partially, while other 
        countries follow current policies leading to increased inequality which would exacerbate 
        regional tensions as well as the physical impacts.
        
        Property values themselves may be impacted by the occurrence, or risk of occurrence, of 
        physical climate-related events from both acute and chronic impacts as outlined below: 

        **Acute impacts**

        - **Cyclones or storms**: Cyclones and storms are likely to have a significant effect on real estate.

          flooding risks to real estate with real estate in coastal areas being particularly vulnerable. 
          For example, Miami and New York are projected to experience significant declines in property 
          values due to rising sea levels.

        **Chronic impacts**

        - **Raised Sea Levels**: Coastal properties are particularly vulnerable to raised sea levels,

        Fragmented World scenario eventually reaching a low of -2.5% in 2050. This could have a 
        knock-on impact on the revenue of the assets linked to the reduced productivity.

        In addition to the physical risks outlined above, the too-little-too-late scenario would also give 
        rise to high transition risks as outlined below. 
        
        For example:
        - **Regulatory Changes**: Stricter building codes and energy efficiency standards can increase costs 
          for retrofitting and developing properties. For example, new regulations may require the installation 
          of energy-efficient HVAC systems, solar panels, or green roofs, significantly increasing upfront costs. 
          Additionally, the introduction of carbon pricing mechanisms can impact the profitability of properties 
          with high carbon footprints.
        
        - **Market Preferences**: Shifts in market preferences towards sustainable and energy-efficient buildings 
          can impact demand for older, less efficient properties. Real estate companies may find it challenging 
          to lease or sell properties that do not meet modern sustainability standards, leading to reduced asset 
          values. For instance, tenants and buyers are increasingly seeking buildings with green certifications, 
          such excellent or good BREEAM certification.
        
        - **Technological Advancements**: Rapid advancements in green building technologies can render existing 
          properties obsolete, leading to stranded assets. Innovations such as smart building systems, 
          energy-efficient materials, and renewable energy integration can make older buildings less competitive. 
          For example, the adoption of smart building technologies that optimise energy use and enhance occupant 
          comfort can disrupt the market for traditional buildings.

        - **Reputational Risks**: Real estate companies that fail to adequately address climate-related risks may 
          suffer reputational damage, affecting their market position and customer trust. This can lead to decreased 
          investor confidence and higher costs of capital. For example, companies that do not implement sustainable 
          practices may face negative publicity and lose tenants or buyers who prioritize environmental responsibility.
        
        Real estate companies can mitigate both physical and transition risks in a too-little-too-late scenario by 
        enhancing building resilience through infrastructure upgrades, implementing flood defence systems, and using 
        climate-resilient landscaping. They should invest in energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy sources 
        to decarbonise assets, obtain sustainable building certifications where possible, and proactively adapt to 
        regulatory changes. Monitoring market trends and embracing smart building technologies can help them stay 
        competitive, while robust climate risk management frameworks and effective communication of sustainability 
        efforts can enhance their reputation and build stakeholder trust. These actions collectively position 
        real estate companies for long-term success despite the challenges posed by climate change.
