    # Motor Underwriting
    The **motor** underwriting class involves insuring cars, trucks, motorcycles,
    and other road vehicles. Motor insurance typically covers drivers for third
    party damage caused by their road vehicle such as damage to other vehicles or
    property and injuries to other people, damage to or loss of their road
    vehicle, and injury to the driver themselves. Cover is usually split across
    these separate expenses, with most countries requiring a minimum of
    third-party cover by law.

    Motor insurance includes individual policies for private vehicle owners as
    well as fleet policies for companies that operate multiple vehicles as part of
    their business.
