    # Life Protection Underwriting
    The **life protection** underwriting class covers term assurance, whole life assurance, mortgage protection, income protection and critical illness written on either an individual or group basis.
    
    Life assurance policies generally pay out a one-off payment of the cover amount on death of the life assured. Policies may be written on whole of life basis, or cover may last for a specified term. The cover amount can be flat over the term of the policy or may decrease over the policy duration.
    
    Critical illness policies provide the pay out on the occurrence of one of a set of predetermined conditions. Depending on the definition, payment may occur on diagnosis, when the condition has progressed to a specified severity or when certain treatments are performed.
    
    Income protection provides a regular income for policyholders who are unable to work due to illness or injury. Payments may last until the policyholder recovers or may be for a predetermined length of time. The main risks covered by Life Protection businesses for consumers are mortality and morbidity. The other key risks life protection businesses are exposed to are expenses, lapses and catastrophes.
