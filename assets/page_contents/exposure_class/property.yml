  test_report_position: 19
  description: |
    The property underwriting class covers a very wide range of asset types 
    and coverages, with risk transfers flowing from the policyholders, through 
    to insurers, reinsurers and retrocessional reinsurers, and with both simple 
    (e.g. direct) and complex risk sharing arrangements between multiple parties, 
    for example through bordereau and other aggregate risk products. Underwriting 
    is the act of accepting liability up to a specified amount in an insurance policy, 
    and generally, property insurance could be related to either fixed, immovable 
    assets such as buildings or movable property, such as transport or goods in 
    transit, in both personal (e.g. residential/domestic) and professional 
    (e.g. landlords, commercial real estate, industrial real estate) settings.
