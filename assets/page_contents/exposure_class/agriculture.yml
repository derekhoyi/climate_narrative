name: Agriculture Sector
test_report_position: 2
description: |
  "**"Agriculture"**" sector can be split into Crop Production and Animal Production. Industries in the Crop Production 
  subsector grow crops mainly for food and fibre. This subsector comprises establishments such as farms, orchards, 
  groves, greenhouses, and nurseries, primarily engaged in growing crops, plants, vines, or trees and their seeds. 
  The industries in this subsector are grouped by similarity of production activity, the length of growing season, 
  degree of crop rotation, extent of input specialization, labour requirements and capital demands.
  The production process is typically completed when the raw product or commodity grown reaches the “farm gate” for 
  market, that is, at the point of first sale or price determination. Within the subsector, the NAICS classifies 
  establishments to a specific industry when a product or industry family of products (i.e., oilseed and grain farming, 
  vegetable and melon farming, fruit and tree nut farming) account for one-half or more of the establishment’s 
  agricultural production.

  Industries in the Animal Production, Fishing and Aquaculture subsector raise or fatten animals for the sale of 
  animals or animal products and/or raise aquatic plants and animals in controlled or selected aquatic environments 
  for the sale of aquatic plants, animals, or their products. The subsector includes establishments, such as ranches, 
  farms, and feedlots primarily engaged in keeping, grazing, breeding, or feeding animals. These animals are kept for 
  the products they produce or for eventual sale. The industries in this subsector are grouped by important factors, 
  such as suitable grazing or pastureland, specialised buildings, type of equipment and the amount and types of labour 
  required.
  Establishments are classified to the Animal Production, Fishing and Aquaculture subsector when animal production 
  (i.e., value of animals for market) accounts for one-half or more of the establishment’s total agricultural production.

      In the Delayed Transition scenario, the agriculture sector can benefit from expanding markets but faces greater 
      risks of stranded assets, geographic growth constraints, and rising production costs in the face of new emissions 
      costs, land use restrictions, and necessary productivity improvements.
    always: |
      The agriculture sector continues to expand to feed and supply agricultural energy products to a growing global 
      population. It contributes to 22% of anthropogenic emissions, exposing its producers and financiers to emerging 
      climate related transition risks through public policies, consumer demand shifts and technological evolutions.
      In the Delayed transition scenario, late policy reaction means that a ‘Business-as-Usual’ approach to decarbonisation 
      occurs between now and 2030, followed by a sharp increase in policy aggression. The delayed policy ambition reduces 
      the initial disincentivisation against fossil fuels, only to more aggressively penalise and thus risk stranding 
      assets beyond 2030. Disorderly policy action results in increased transition risks. Agricultural value chains face 
      material climate transition risk exposure due to their emissions intensity and reliance on land. Under this scenario, 
      the expansion of land protection policies and carbon payments made to preserve and expand forests could reduce land 
      available for agriculture.

      In this scenario, it could also lead to a reduction in GDP growth. This could result in changes in the rate of growth 
      in demand for the agriculture sector, although the impact is likely to be limited due to inelastic demand for food 
      products.
    high_materiality: |
      The changes in food and bioenergy demand, emission pricing or taxes, consumer preferences and land use restrictions 
      could potentially result in one or more of the following financial impacts:

      - "**"Revenue growth:"**" this occurs due to rising global demand and commodity prices. E.g.: A rice farm in Thailand 
      sees sporadic revenue spikes due to sudden global food shortages triggered by extreme weather events and trade 
      restrictions in other countries. However, inconsistent demand and volatile commodity prices, driven by erratic 
      climate policies and protectionist tariffs, make revenue unpredictable, with periods of oversupply crashing prices.

      - "**"Rising production costs:"**" this occurs due to higher input costs and GHG emissions costs. E.g.: A corn farm in 
      Mexico faces sharply rising costs as fertilizer prices surge due to sudden export bans from major suppliers reacting 
      to global energy crises. Additionally, a hastily implemented national carbon tax, introduced without clear guidelines, 
      increases fuel costs for farm machinery, with no transitional support to offset the financial burden.

      - "**"Increase in capital expenditures:"**" this may occur as farms need to invest in research and development and 
      deployment of new technologies necessary for long-term productivity growth. E.g.: A soybean farm in Argentina 
      is forced to rapidly invest in expensive, unproven precision agriculture technologies (e.g., AI-driven crop 
      monitoring systems) to comply with sudden EU import regulations requiring low-carbon farming practices. The 
      lack of local R&D support and high borrowing costs for capital investments strain the farm’s finances, with uncertain 
      returns.

      - "**"More write-offs of assets:"**" this may occur as expansion of land protection policies to preserve and expand forests
      could reduce land available for agriculture. E.g.: A cattle ranch in Australia writes off significant land assets after 
      an abrupt government mandate designates large swathes of grazing land as protected zones to meet international carbon 
      commitments made under pressure. The lack of prior notice or compensation programs leaves the ranch unable to relocate 
      or repurpose the land, forcing a costly reduction in herd size.

      The agriculture sector can benefit from expanding markets but faces greater risks of stranded assets, geographic growth 
      constraints, and rising production costs in the face of new emissions costs, land use restrictions, and necessary 
      productivity improvements. The sector has very high GHG emissions as farm and livestock productions and activities 
      are emission intensive. In the Delayed transition, agriculture sector’s GHG emissions are projected to fall, 
      especially after 2030 (c. 62% by 2050 vs 2030).

      As the use of bioenergy increases, by 2050, approx. 23% of total agricultural production in the Delayed 
      transition scenario, is consumed for energy generation.

      The agriculture sector is key driver of forest loss, and due to forest conservation and preservation policies, 
      availability of agricultural land reduces, limiting the growth of agricultural land cover. However, technological 
      innovations in yields and productivity increase land use efficiency, allowing agriculture production to continue 
      to increase with the rising demand of food and energy due to population growth. By 2050, agricultural land could 
      decrease by around 72 million hectares in the Delayed transition scenario. Forest cover could increase by around 
      210 million hectares.

      The operational and production costs of firms could increase as they need to make necessary investments for 
      technological upgrades and increase in carbon taxes. But producers should be able to pass the higher input costs 
      to consumers due to inelastic demand of food and increasing usage of clean bioenergy and biofuels. Despite these 
      material risks, agricultural companies and investors can also derive significant opportunities from climate 
      transitions. By investing in sustainable intensification, regenerative agriculture, and diversifying revenue streams, 
      forward-looking agricultural companies could see their net value and profitability rise under transitions.
      In a Delayed transition scenario, mitigation actions at the state and firm levels must address heightened 
      uncertainty, rapid cost escalations, and asset risks. Below are targeted mitigation actions to navigate the 
      chaotic environment of a disorderly transition:
      
      State level actions:
      - "**"Emergency financial support programs:"**" Establish rapid-response funds or loan guarantees to stabilize 
      farmers facing sudden cost spikes from input shortages or new carbon taxes.
      - "**"Flexible regulatory frameworks:"**" Implement adaptive policies with phased-in compliance timelines to 
      ease the burden of sudden carbon pricing or emissions regulations.
      - "**"Trade and supply chain stabilisation:"**" Negotiate bilateral trade agreements or stockpile critical inputs 
      (e.g., fertilizers) to buffer against export bans and price volatility.
      - "**"Accelerated R&D investment:"**" Fund crash programs for climate-resilient technologies, such as drought-tolerant 
      seeds or low-cost methane capture, to quickly equip farmers for policy and climate shocks.
      
      Firm level actions:
      - "**"Diversify input sourcing:"**" Secure multiple suppliers for critical inputs like fertilizers and fuel to mitigate 
      risks from sudden price surges or export bans.
      - "**"Hedge against price volatility:"**" Use financial instruments like futures contracts to lock in commodity prices 
      and protect against market swings
      - "**"Modular technology investments:"**" Adopt scalable, low-cost technologies (e.g., portable soil sensors or leased 
      drones) to meet new regulations without heavy upfront CapEx.
      - "**"Proactive asset diversification:"**" Spread risk by investing in off-farm assets or leasing land instead of 
      purchasing to avoid write-offs from sudden policy changes.

      In Orderly transition scenarios, the agriculture sector can benefit from expanding markets but face greater risks 
      of stranded assets, geographic growth constraints, and rising production costs in the face of new emissions costs, 
      land use restrictions, and necessary productivity improvements.

      The agriculture sector continues to expand to feed and supply agricultural energy products to a growing global 
      population. Agriculture sector including forestry and land use contributes to 22% of anthropogenic emissions as 
      of 2020 (source: NGFS), exposing its producers and financiers to emerging climate-related transition risks through 
      public policies, consumer demand shifts and technological evolutions.
      By 2050, the Orderly transition scenarios driven by societal change, national energy strategies, and carbon 
      legislation, are likely to have a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Agricultural value chains face material 
      climate transition risk exposure due to their emissions intensity and reliance on land. A potential expansion of land 
      protection policies and carbon payments made to preserve and expand forests could reduce land available for agriculture.
      These scenarios could also lead to a limited relative reduction in GDP growth and could result in changes in the rate 
      of growth in demand for the agriculture sector, although the impact is likely to be limited due to inelastic demand 
      for food products.

    high_materiality: |
      The changes in food and bioenergy demand, emission pricing or taxes, consumer preferences and land use restrictions 
      could potentially result in one or more of the following financial impacts, for example:

      - "**"Revenue growth:"**" this occurs in line with global demand and commodity prices. E.g.: A soybean farm in Brazil 
      may experience increased revenue due to rising global demand for plant-based proteins, driven by dietary shifts 
      in developed markets. Stable commodity prices, supported by predictable trade policies and climate-resilient crop 
      varieties, allow the farm to maintain consistent income growth despite regional climate variability.
      -	"**"Rising production costs:"**" this occurs due to higher input costs and GHG emissions costs. E.g.: A dairy farm 
      in the Netherlands faces higher costs for feed and fertilizer due to supply chain constraints and carbon taxes on 
      energy-intensive inputs. Additionally, the farm incurs expenses from a national carbon pricing scheme that charges 
      for methane emissions from livestock, pushing up overall operational costs (however to note, incentives to reduce 
      methane emissions are not explicitly covered by the scenario).
      -	"**"Increase in capital expenditures:"**" this may occur as farms need to invest in research and development and 
      deployment of new technologies and farming approaches necessary for long-term productivity growth. Eg: A wheat 
      farm in Australia invests in precision agriculture technologies, such as IoT-enabled soil sensors and automated 
      irrigation systems, to optimise water use and boost yields under stricter water regulations. The farm also funds 
      R&D for drought-resistant crop varieties to ensure long-term productivity in a warming climate.
      -	"**"More write-off of assets:"**" this may occur as expansion of land protection policies to preserve and expand 
      forests could reduce land available for agriculture. Eg: A cattle ranch in the United States writes off portions 
      of its grazing land value after new federal policies designate adjacent areas as protected zones to restore 
      native forests and sequester carbon. The reduced available land forces the ranch to downsize its herd or shift 
      to alternative revenue streams, like agroforestry.
      
      The agriculture sector can benefit from expanding markets but faces greater risks of stranded assets, geographic 
      growth constraints, and rising production costs in the face of new emissions costs, land use restrictions, and 
      necessary productivity improvements.
      The sector has very high GHG emissions as farm and livestock productions and activities are emissions intensive. 
      In Orderly transition scenarios, although the agriculture sector’s GHG emissions are projected to fall, it is to 
      a lesser extent than other sectors, making agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) the largest GHG 
      emitting sector by 2050. Although AFOLU GHG emissions decrease by c. 67% by 2050 vs 2025 levels, share of AFOLU 
      in total GHG emissions increase from 21% in 2025 to c. 62% in 2050 in NZ scenario

      The total demand including food, non-food and feed products (crops and livestock) and bioenergy crops could 
      continue to increase in the Orderly transition scenarios, however growth in demand for only food production 
      is limited. Significantly higher agricultural demand in Net Zero scenario is primarily driven by the demand 
      for bioenergy.

      The agriculture sector is highly exposed to physical risk due to the projected increase in weather variation. 
      These scenarios could also lead to a significant GDP impact which could negatively impact demand for this sector.
    always: |
      The agriculture sector is highly exposed to physical risk. Chronic effects (e.g. raised sea-levels and mean temperatures) 
      and acute effects due to changes to frequency and severity of weather events such as heatwaves, wildfires, cyclones, 
      and flooding are adding to pressures on global agricultural and food systems and could lead to severe disruption to 
      agricultural production which could impact the profitability for some companies in long-run. Whilst the agriculture 
      sector is used to responding to and managing changing weather conditions, in the high physical risk scenario, climate 
      change and global warming could increase weather variations.
      Adverse impacts on world GDP from physical risks are assumed in the scenarios and these vary in line with different 
      temperatures projected for each scenario. The high physical risk scenarios could therefore also lead to a significant 
      GDP impact which could negatively affect demand for agriculture, although the impact is likely to be limited due to 
      inelastic demand for food products.

    high_materiality: |
      The agriculture sector is key driver of forest loss, and lack of preservation policies, result in increasing usage 
      of land for agriculture purposes. In this scenario, cropland increases by 112 million ha while the forest cover reduces 
      by c. 74 million ha by 2050 vs 2020 levels.

      The following examples illustrate how the agriculture sector could be impacted in a high physical risk scenario:

      "**"Chronic Impacts"**"
      
      -	"**"Increase in sea-level rise:"**" this may lead to substantial losses in crop and livestock production in low-lying 
      agricultural areas and may contribute to waterlogging and soil erosion. Wetter weather could threaten agricultural 
      production by adversely affecting crop yields.
      -	"**"Higher average temperatures:"**"  this could have an impact on production, this could vary across the regions. Warmer, 
      drier climates in tropical regions may have a negative impact on production, whereas production in colder and wetter 
      areas may benefit from warm conditions.
      -	"**"Shifting Precipitation Patterns:"**" Changes in rainfall timing and volume could disrupt planting and harvesting 
      seasons. Regions dependent on monsoon rains might face prolonged dry seasons, while others see excessive water, 
      both reducing arable land viability.
      -	"**"Soil Degradation:"**" Increased erosion from erratic weather, combined with higher evaporation rates. Countries 
      without mitigation efforts might see faster desertification.
      -	"**"Water Resource Decline:"**" Gradual depletion of groundwater and shrinking rivers/lakes due to overuse and 
      reduced recharge would limit irrigation capacity, especially in arid regions unaffected by net zero policies.


      "**"Acute Impacts"**"

      -	"**"Changing rainfall patterns and reduced availability of water for irrigation:"**"  this could threaten agricultural 
      production, particularly in areas where water supplies are already under pressure. Drier soil conditions could reduce 
      growth of crops, pasture and trees. Extended or repeated period of droughts may cause death of younger tress reducing 
      forest productivity.
      -	"**"Increased frequency and intensity of wildfires, cyclones or storms:"**" this could cause significant damage to 
      forests and disrupt the natural ecosystems that have been developed around the forests.
      -	"**"Significantly slowed GDP growth:"**" this could impact demand for agriculture through its effect on individuals’ 
      disposable income. The impact on food products is likely to be low due to inelastic demand, and increased demand for 
      bioenergy could offset any reduction in food demand.
      -	"**"Range and quality of the ecosystem services:"**" agriculture and forestry not only provide for, but also rely on 
      ecosystem services. These include climate control, flood regulation, biodiversity, pollination and nutrient cycling. 
      The agriculture and forestry sectors have already adapted to change by introducing new genotypes, varieties, breeds 
      and management practices. In a high physical risk scenario, there could be a need for more anticipatory adaptation 
      measures.


      In a hot house world scenario, mitigation actions at the state and firm levels must focus on adapting to severe 
      climate risks, managing escalating costs, and ensuring food security amidst declining yields and resource scarcity.
      
      State level actions:
      - Fund robust irrigation systems, flood defenses, and heat-resistant storage facilities to protect agricultural 
      productivity
      - Support farmers in adopting drought-tolerant, heat-resistant, or flood-tolerant crop varieties through subsidies 
      or free seed distribution
      -	Early warning disaster response systems to help farmers prepare for extreme events
      -	Water resource management policies: Implement strict water allocation policies and invest in desalination or 
      water recycling to secure supply for agriculture in water-scarce regions
      
      Firm level actions:
      -	Crop diversification: Plant a mix of climate-resilient crops to reduce risk from weather variability 
      and ensure consistent revenue.
      -	Water-efficient technologies: Invest in drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting, or soil moisture sensors 
      to optimize water use in drought-prone areas.
      -	On-farm renewable energy: Adopt solar or wind energy for farm operations to reduce reliance on unreliable 
      or costly grid power during extreme weather disruptions.
      -	Insurance and risk management: Having climate insurance to cover losses from extreme weather events, ensuring 
      financial stability.
      -	Soil health investments: Implement regenerative practices like cover cropping or organic amendments to 
      enhance soil resilience against erosion and heat stress.

      In a Fragmented World scenario, with countries pursuing net zero targets imposing stringent policies, 
      strains agriculture through higher costs and market shifts, while others without new policies face delayed 
      climate impacts and trade disadvantages.
    always: |
      In a scenario where countries with net zero targets implement stringent climate policies while others adopt 
      no new measures, the agriculture sector faces a sharply divided landscape. In net zero countries, farmers 
      encounter rigorous regulations—such as carbon taxes, limits on fertilizer use, or mandates for renewable 
      energy—driving up production costs as they transition to low-emission practices like agroforestry or 
      methane-reducing livestock systems (however to note, incentives to reduce methane emissions are not 
      explicitly covered by the scenario). These farmers may also adapt to shifting consumer preferences for 
      sustainable goods, requiring investment in certification or new technologies. Conversely, countries without 
      new policies continue business-as-usual, avoiding immediate cost increases but remaining exposed to escalating 
      climate risks like heatwaves, soil degradation, or water scarcity, with little institutional support for 
      adaptation. Over time, this fragmentation threatens food security as uncoordinated climate impacts and trade 
      distortions ripple across borders.

      In the Fragmented world scenario, although the agriculture sector’s GHG emissions are projected to fall, it is

      As the use of bioenergy increases, by 2050, approx. 17% of total agricultural production in the Fragmented 
      world scenario is consumed for energy generation.

      The agriculture sector is key driver of forest loss, and due to forest conservation and preservation policies, 
      availability of agricultural land reduces, limiting the growth of agricultural land cover. However, technological 
      innovations in yields and productivity increase land use efficiency, allowing agriculture production to continue 
      to increase with the rising demand of food and energy due to population growth. By 2050, agricultural land could 
      increase by around 71 million hectares in the Fragmented world scenario. Forest cover could increase by around 46 
      million hectares.

      Uneven implementation of climate policies across countries causes transition risks:
      -	"**"Uneven cost pressures:"**" Farmers in policy-stringent regions (e.g., EU) face higher production costs from 
      carbon taxes and emissions regulations, while those in lax regions (e.g., parts of Asia and Africa) avoid these 
      but risk future trade penalties.
      -	"**"Market access challenges:"**" Stringent regions may impose carbon border adjustments, limiting market access 
      for agricultural exports from non-compliant countries, disrupting global supply chains.
      -	"**"Technology adoption gaps:"**" Advanced economies invest in climate-smart technologies (e.g., precision 
      agriculture), boosting productivity, while others lag, creating competitive disparities.
      
      In this scenario, physical risks stem from rising global temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and increasing 
      frequency of extreme events, exacerbated by uneven mitigation efforts. 
      
      Acute Impacts
      
      -	"**"Floods:"**" Heavy rainfall and rising sea levels could inundate farmland, destroy crops, and erode soil, 
      particularly in low-lying regions like deltas or coastal areas. Countries with net zero policies might mitigate 
      some local flooding through infrastructure, but global sea level rise would still affect all.
      -	"**"Droughts:"**" Prolonged dry spells, worsened by higher temperatures and uneven precipitation, could devastate 
      crop yields and livestock in both policy-active and inactive regions. Water scarcity would hit rain-fed 
      agriculture hardest, especially in areas already prone to aridity.
      -	"**"Heatwaves:"**" Extreme heat events could kill livestock, reduce crop productivity (e.g., wheat, maize), and 
      impair farmworker safety. Regions without emission cuts would amplify global warming, making heatwaves more 
      frequent worldwide.
      -	"**"Storms and Hurricanes:"**" Stronger tropical storms, fuelled by warmer oceans, could flatten crops, damage 
      infrastructure and disrupt supply chains. Coastal agricultural zones would be particularly vulnerable.
      
      Chronic Impacts
      
      -	"**"Rising Temperatures:"**" Sustained higher average temperatures could push crops beyond their optimal growing 
      ranges, reducing yields for staples like rice, corn, and soybeans. Heat stress would also lower livestock 
      fertility and milk production.
      	-	"**"Shifting Precipitation Patterns:"**" Changes in rainfall timing and volume could disrupt planting and 
        harvesting seasons. Regions dependent on monsoon rains might face prolonged dry seasons, while others see 
        excessive water, both reducing arable land viability.
        -	"**"Soil Degradation:"**" Increased erosion from erratic weather, combined with higher evaporation rates. 
        Countries without mitigation efforts might see faster desertification.
        -	"**"Water Resource Decline:"**" Gradual depletion of groundwater and shrinking rivers/lakes due to overuse 
        and reduced recharge would limit irrigation capacity, especially in arid regions unaffected by net zero policies.
        -	"**"Sea Level Rise:"**" Slow but steady coastal flooding would salinize soils and freshwater sources, rendering 
        large swathes of farmland unusable over decades, particularly in countries with no adaptive measures.
      
        In a Fragmented world scenario, mitigation actions at the state and firm levels must address divergent 
        policy pressures, market access risks, and competitive disparities.
      
        State level actions:
        - Harmonized trade policies: Trade agreements to minimize the impact of carbon border adjustment mechanisms 
        (CBAM) imposed by stringent regions.
        - Targeted subsidies for compliance: Provide subsidies or tax breaks to farmers in policy-stringent regions 
        to offset costs of adopting low-carbon practices mandated by advanced economies. 
        - Technology transfer programs: Facilitate access to climate-smart technologies (e.g., precision agriculture tools) 
        for farmers in lax-policy regions through partnerships with advanced economies or international organizations.
        - Buffer against market volatility: Create national or regional stockpiles of key inputs like fertilizers to shield 
        farmers from supply chain disruptions caused by global policy disparities.
      
        Firm-level actions:
        - Dual-track production systems: Adapt operations to meet stringent export standards for advanced markets while 
        maintaining cost-effective practices for domestic or lax markets.
        - Strategic market diversifiaction: Expand market reach to include countries with less stringent regulations 
        to hedge against CBAM or trade barriers.
        - Supply chain resilience: Build relationships with diverse suppliers across regions to mitigate risks from 
        trade disruptions or input shortages.
